# Changelog

All notable changes to CLI Pulse Desktop (Windows + Linux).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed — Codex cost estimate

- **Codex prices follow OpenAI's published rates.** `gpt-5.5` was priced at the `gpt-5.4` placeholder
  ($2.50 / $15 per 1M) that was added before its prices existed; it is now $5 / $30. `gpt-6-astra`,
  `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5.6-cyber` and `gpt-5.5-cyber` had no rates at all and
  showed no cost; they are priced now. The aliases `gpt-5.6`, `gpt-reserve` and the Daybreak names resolve to
  the model they route to. The table follows the one bundled with steipete/CodexBar (MIT).
- **Codex cost is priced per request.** A request with more than 272K input tokens is billed at the model's
  long-context rates for the whole request, and a repriced model keeps its old rate for requests made before
  the change (Sol before 2026-08-21, Terra and Luna before 2026-07-30). Both need the request, not the day,
  so Codex cost is now summed per request while parsing, as Claude's already was.
- **A Codex rollout that exists in two places is counted once.** The scan reads both `sessions/` and
  `archived_sessions/` (and each WSL distro's), and told files apart only by path. A copy with the same
  rollout id whose events overlap in time is now left out; a rollout continued in a second file still counts
  in full, and sub-agent rollouts are unaffected.
- **A Codex counter that drops can no longer be counted twice.** When a rollout's cumulative token counter
  jumped back up after a drop, the gap between the two values was counted again. Growth is now counted above
  the highest value seen, or since the previous value while below it, so a restarted counter still counts
  and a flip-flopping one cannot double. The counter also advances on events outside the scan window, so a
  rollout that began before the window no longer puts its earlier usage on the window's first day.
- The Codex scan cache is rebuilt once after updating (Claude's is kept), so the new rules reach every file.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added — terminal epic (T3)

- **Multi-provider terminal (passthrough).** The in-app terminal now spawns **Codex** and **Gemini** too,
  not just Claude: a provider picker (Claude / Codex / Gemini) in the pane spawns that provider's own
  installed CLI through the same resolve-PATH → spawn → stream path (their own creds — passthrough, no managed
  auth). Per-provider availability check (shows "install it" guidance when a provider's CLI isn't found), and
  "Start {provider}". Backend: a `Provider` enum + generalized `provider_argv` / `provider_available` (the
  `claude`-specific resolver is now provider-parameterized); `terminal_start` takes an optional `provider`
  (defaults Claude — non-breaking). New `terminal.provider_missing` label; `start_button` now interpolates the
  provider name (×3 locales).

## [0.11.0] — 2026-07-13

**The in-app terminal.** A local terminal is now built into the app (Sessions tab): click **Start
Claude** to run your own `claude` on this machine and drive it in an embedded xterm.js pane — spawn,
stream, type/paste/Ctrl-C, resize, and exit-detection, plus a local usage signal. Backend reuses the
hardened ConPTY/PTY transport (Ctrl-C, Windows Job Objects, Drop teardown); output streams over a
single-flight rAF pump reading raw ArrayBuffers so it never reorders. `claude` is resolved robustly
(PATH + common install dirs; Windows `.cmd` shim), with graceful "install Claude" guidance when it's
missing. Every slice was adversarially reviewed. (Multi-provider managed spawn — Codex/Gemini on-plan —
is the next phase.)

### Added — terminal epic

- **Robust `claude` resolution for the in-app terminal.** A GUI-launched app inherits a thin PATH (no
  login-shell rc), so bare `claude` often wouldn't resolve. `claude_argv()` now resolves to an absolute path —
  PATH first (the shell-launched / `tauri dev` case), then common install dirs (`~/.local/bin`,
  `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, npm-global, …). On Windows an npm-global `claude` is a `.cmd`/`.ps1`
  shim ConPTY can't spawn directly, so it's wrapped in `cmd /c`. **Verified on macOS end-to-end**: the real
  `LocalTerminalManager` spawns `claude` and streams `claude --version` back through `read_stdout`, and
  `claude_argv()` resolves `~/.local/bin/claude`. Windows shim path is VM-verified. Unit-tested (PATH search,
  exec-bit check, shim wrapping).
- **In-app terminal — exit handling + telemetry (T2.3c / T2.3d).** The terminal now notices a child that
  exits on its own: a `terminal_status` poll flushes the last output, prints `[process exited N]`, and returns
  the pane to **Start** (T2.3c). The pump was factored into a single-flight `drainOnce` shared by the pump and
  the exit-flush. Backgrounded windows intentionally show the *tail* of a burst (rAF pauses while hidden; the
  bounded ring drops-oldest) — correct terminal semantics, documented. And a **local-only** launched-count
  (T2.3d): a `terminal_launched_count` command + a `log::info!` per launch (a bare count + pid — no cwd / argv
  / output) + a subtle "Launched N this session" line, so we can tell whether the in-app terminal is actually
  used. It is **never uploaded**; shipping an aggregate for real adoption analytics would be a shared-schema
  change (owner's call). New `terminal.exited` / `exited_unknown` / `launched_count` labels ×3 locales.
- **In-app terminal — live streaming (T2.3b).** The `LocalTerminal` pane is now interactive: a **Start**
  button spawns the user's own `claude` (`terminal_start`), syncs the PTY size to the fitted pane, and streams
  it into xterm.js via a **single-flight requestAnimationFrame pump** — each frame drains the stdout ring with
  `terminal_read` (raw ArrayBuffer → `term.write(Uint8Array)`) and only *then* schedules the next frame, so two
  destructive drains can never overlap/reorder the output. Keystrokes/paste/Ctrl-C flow via `term.onData` →
  `terminal_write`; xterm's `onResize` round-trips (debounced) to `terminal_resize`. **Stop** (and unmount)
  cancel the pump, detach listeners, and `terminal_close` the session — no leaked pump/listener/session. DOM
  renderer only (no WebGL/canvas) so the headless launch-smoke stays crash-safe. New `terminal.start_button` /
  `stop_button` / `starting` / `start_failed` / `stopped` labels ×3 locales, pinned. *Live streaming +
  `claude` PATH resolution get a real-run/VM verification (see the T2.3b runbook); CI covers compile + the
  crash-safe headless render.*
- **In-app terminal pane — xterm.js skeleton (T2.3a).** A new `src/components/LocalTerminal.tsx` mounts an
  **xterm.js** terminal (added `@xterm/xterm` + `@xterm/addon-fit`) under the **Sessions** tab: it fits to its
  container and re-fits on resize (ResizeObserver). This slice is the crash-safe skeleton — xterm init is
  wrapped in try/catch with a fallback so the CI launch-smoke's headless all-tabs render can't white-screen.
  Launching a session (Start → `terminal_start`) and the single-flight streaming pump land in T2.3b; the
  backend command surface already exists (T2.1/T2.2a/T2.2b). New `terminal.*` labels ×3 locales, pinned in the
  critical-labels gate.
- **Local terminal streaming I/O (T2.2b).** Three more Tauri commands on the `LocalTerminalManager`:
  `terminal_write` (keystrokes/paste/Ctrl-C → stdin; runs `write_stdin` on the blocking pool so a full stdin
  pipe never parks the async runtime), `terminal_read` (drains pending stdout as a **raw binary
  `ipc::Response` ArrayBuffer** — never a `Vec<u8>` JSON number-array nor a Rust-side `String` that would split
  UTF-8/ANSI across chunks; xterm.js decodes), and `terminal_resize` (best-effort — a `ResizeFailed` from
  resizing an already-exited child is swallowed). Manager read/write/resize + NotFound cases unit-tested;
  real-spawn read-capture + write-round-trip-through-`cat` tests added (ignored). The xterm.js pane that
  consumes these is the next slice (T2.3); the raw-ArrayBuffer round-trip will be VM/UI-verified there.
- **Local terminal registry + lifecycle (T2.2a).** A new `terminal.rs` `LocalTerminalManager` — the
  backend for an in-app terminal that spawns the user's own `claude` on **this** machine (a new local path
  reusing the `ConPtyTransport` PTY primitive but bypassing the Supabase remote-agent layer; a separate
  transport instance, zero shared state). Three Tauri commands: `terminal_start` (→ id + pid, capped at 4
  concurrent), `terminal_close` (idempotent; drops the handle → child kill + Windows Job Object teardown),
  `terminal_status` (running + exit_code). Managed unconditionally (needs no pairing). Lifecycle only — byte
  I/O (write/read) is the next slice, resize landed in T2.1. Cap + not-found + idempotency unit-tested;
  real-spawn lifecycle + cap-enforcement tests added (ignored, like the transport's).
- **PTY resize round-trip (T2.1).** Added `resize(rows, cols)` to the transport — round-trips to
  `ResizePseudoConsole` (Windows) / `TIOCSWINSZ` (POSIX) via portable-pty and delivers SIGWINCH so a
  spawned CLI's line-wrapping tracks the terminal pane. This required relocating the PTY master: it was
  moved into the reader thread as a keepalive (unreachable); it now lives behind `Arc<Mutex<…>>` shared
  between the reader thread (still a keepalive) and `HandleInner`, so `resize` can reach it — teardown
  (Drop → reader_stop / child kill / Job Object) is unchanged. `terminal_smoke` now also asserts a resize
  round-trip; mock + real-spawn (ignored) tests added.
- **PTY stdout streaming foundation (T0/T2 slice 1).** The managed-session PTY host
  (`remote/transport.rs`, portable-pty) previously read the child's stdout on a dedicated
  thread and **discarded** every chunk (`read_stdout` was an empty stub) — the host only
  posted lifecycle events to Supabase for a *remote* controller; nothing streamed locally.
  The reader thread now pumps output into a **bounded shared ring** (`STDOUT_BUF_CAP` = 256 KiB,
  drop-oldest on overflow so a headless remote session that never reads stays memory-bounded),
  and `read_stdout` drains it. This is the byte source a future in-app **xterm.js** terminal
  polls (raw bytes, no ANSI strip / no decode — xterm handles that). Reused the existing
  hardened transport (Ctrl-C via 0x03, Windows Job Objects, Drop teardown) — no rebuild.
- **`terminal_smoke` streaming harness (T0).** A new `cargo run --bin terminal_smoke` spawns a
  short child that emits lines over ~1.5 s and asserts the output arrives **incrementally**
  (bytes seen while the child is still running, across multiple reads) — not drained at exit.
  Cross-platform via portable-pty, so it proves streaming on Linux/macOS (POSIX openpty) and
  Windows (ConPTY); asserts the **local** signal only (no async-Sentry dependency). Wired into
  CI (advisory) on Windows + Linux; `scripts/vm-verify-terminal.ps1` runs it on the Windows VM.
  Unit-tested `push_bounded` (drop-oldest bound) gates CI; the real-spawn read test is `#[ignore]`d
  (CI ConPTY flake) like the existing one.

## [0.10.2] — 2026-07-11

**Compare mode (period-over-period).** Closes the last deferred v0.10.0 item. A new **Settings → Date range**
toggle, *"Compare to previous period,"* adds a compact **▲/▼ N% vs prev** badge next to the window-level
figures on **Overview** (the *Last N-days cost* tile + each provider-usage bar) and **Providers** (each
provider's cost and I/O tokens). It compares the current N-day window against the equal-length window
immediately before it (e.g. the last 30 days vs the 30 days before). Up (more spend/usage) reads amber, down
reads emerald, brand-new activity reads "new," and a zero previous window never renders `+Infinity%`.

### Added

- **Compare-to-previous-period toggle + delta badges.** The window math lives in a pure, unit-tested
  `src/lib/compare.ts` (21 Vitest cases): it slices per-day scan entries into current vs previous windows and
  computes safe signed-percent deltas. It is **timezone-safe** — every boundary is a local `YYYY-MM-DD`
  day-key shifted via UTC-noon arithmetic, so no host clock or DST transition can move a day (tests inject
  `todayKey`). The toggle is persisted in `localStorage` (`src/lib/comparePrefs.ts`, unit-tested) and defaults
  **off**. Compare is offered only for ranges **≤ 90 days** (a wider range can't get an equal prior window
  inside the scanner's 180-day cap); the toggle disables itself with an explanatory hint beyond that.
  - **Correct previous period without fighting the main scan's cache.** The main `scan_usage(days)` prunes its
    cache to the selected window on every run and skips unchanged files, so naively widening the window on a
    warm cache under-reports the older half. Compare mode instead uses a new **`scan_usage_baseline`** command
    that scans a fixed **180-day** window into its **own cache namespace** (`cost-usage/compare`), so it stays
    incrementally warm at full width and never gets pruned narrow — the previous period is always complete. It
    runs only while compare is enabled and re-slices client-side as the range changes. No shared-schema or
    server change. New `settings.compare_*` (×3) + `compare.badge_*` (×2) keys across all 3 locales;
    `settings.compare_label` / `compare.badge_new` / `compare.badge_tooltip` pinned in the critical-labels gate.

## [0.10.1] — 2026-07-09

**Parity-closeout sprint.** Two threads: the deferred v0.10.0 items (per-provider visibility, **date-range
picker**, and **export** all now done) and a macOS/iOS parity pass driven by a gap audit against the Mac app
(v1.28) — closing the remaining verifiable gaps (per-provider cache hit-rate, usage-pace markers, native-vs-WSL
split, refresh-on-focus, auto-export) plus the optional always-on-top window mode. (`compare` mode remains the
one deferred v0.10.0 item.)

### Added

- **Always-on-top window mode** — a new **Settings → Window** toggle floats CLI Pulse above other windows so
  the monitor stays visible while you work (the plan's optional P2 window-modes item). Persisted in
  `localStorage` (`src/lib/windowPrefs.ts`, unit-tested) and applied via Tauri's `setAlwaysOnTop`; the saved
  preference is re-applied at app startup. Added the minimal `core:window:allow-set-always-on-top` capability;
  best-effort (silently skipped if the window API is unavailable, e.g. headless CI). New `settings.window_*` /
  `always_on_top*` keys ×3 locales; `settings.window_heading` pinned in the critical-labels gate.

- **Auto-export + "Save to Downloads"** — the export section can now write your usage straight to a **folder**
  (default Downloads), and optionally **auto-export on a schedule** (CSV / JSON / both, every N minutes) while
  the app is open — so an external dashboard or billing sheet stays current without clicking Export. Closes the
  deferred v0.10.0 export item + `DEV_PLAN_2026-07-08_desktop_next_phase.md` §3 P1.5 (export half).
  - **No new plugin/capability:** a small Rust `write_export_file` command reuses `dirs::download_dir()` +
    `std::fs::write` (the diagnostic-bundle precedent) — no `tauri-plugin-fs`/`-dialog`. The target directory
    is **fixed to Downloads** (deliberately not caller-chosen, so the IPC command can't be turned into a
    write-anywhere primitive), and the filename is sanitized to a bare basename: split on **both** `/` and `\`
    host-independently AND reject any remaining `:` — a bare Windows drive/ADS prefix like `C:evil.txt` carries
    no separator yet `PathBuf::join` treats it as a prefix that discards the base dir on Windows, which would
    escape Downloads (found by an adversarial review; unit-tested). The CSV shape is factored into one pure
    `buildUsageCsv` helper in `src/lib/autoExport.ts` (reused by the download button + auto-export; the old
    inline CSV builder is gone). Settings persist in `localStorage` and **default to disabled**, with a
    tolerant loader (bad JSON / unknown format / out-of-range interval all fail safe to off). Auto-export uses
    stable filenames (overwrites the latest, no file pile-up), reads the live scan via a ref so its timer
    isn't reset by every scan, and swallows write failures. New `settings.export_*` / `auto_export_*` keys ×3
    locales; `settings.auto_export_label` pinned in the critical-labels gate. 12 new Vitest cases + a Rust
    `sanitize_export_name` test.

- **Refresh-on-focus** — the local usage scan now re-runs when the app window regains focus, so switching back
  to CLI Pulse shows fresh usage immediately instead of waiting up to 2 minutes for the next background tick.
  Learned from CodexBar's window-focus dimension (`DEV_PLAN_2026-07-07_competitive_learnings.md` §3b B1, the
  deferred focus half). Throttled to once per 30 s so rapid alt-tabbing doesn't spam re-scans, and it only
  rescans the cheap **local** logs (not a full server sync), so it doesn't fight the power-adaptive background
  cadence. Uses Tauri's `onFocusChanged`; best-effort (silently skipped if unavailable) and inert under the
  headless launch-smoke. Closes `DEV_PLAN_2026-07-08_desktop_next_phase.md` §3 P1.5 (focus half).

- **Native-vs-WSL usage split on the Machine tab** — Windows developers often run Claude Code / Codex
  **inside a WSL distro**, whose logs we already scan via the `\\wsl.localhost\<distro>\` share and merge into
  the totals — but that merge was **silent**. The Machine tab now shows a **"Usage sources"** breakdown
  (Native vs. each WSL distro, by tokens) whenever WSL usage is present, so you can see how much of your usage
  comes from there. Closes `DEV_PLAN_2026-07-08_desktop_next_phase.md` §3 P1.4.
  - **No cache-schema change** (the invasive option the audit flagged): origin is derived from each **cached
    file's absolute path** at emit time (`wsl::classify_origin` — pure, case/slash-tolerant, unit-tested), so
    it survives warm/incremental scans (the cache is keyed by path and retains every tracked file) without
    bumping `CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION` or forcing a full rescan. `scanner::origin_usage` walks the per-file cache
    entries and sums the token slots per provider (Codex `[input, cached, output]`; Claude excludes the
    `cost_nanos`/`msgs` slots), returning a new `ScanResult.origin_usage` (`#[serde(default)]`, so old callers
    are unaffected). Both are unit-tested (native/WSL classification + a mixed-provider split + out-of-range
    exclusion). The section is **only** rendered when a WSL origin is actually present, so macOS / Linux /
    Windows-without-WSL users see nothing new. New `machine.source_*` keys × 3 locales;
    `machine.sources_heading` pinned in the critical-labels gate.

- **Usage-pace text + expected-pace marker on the quota bars (F1/F2b parity)** — each Providers-tab quota
  tier now shows whether you're **ahead of pace / on track / under pace** and draws a sky-blue **expected-pace
  marker** on the bar (where the remaining fill *would* be if usage tracked elapsed time). Closes
  `DEV_PLAN_2026-07-08_desktop_next_phase.md` §3 P1.3, extending the v1.30 F2a 80/95% warning ticks.
  - **Client-local, no schema change** (the plan's §7 Q1 preference): the tier data reaching the frontend
    (server `provider_summary`) carries only the reset *end* timestamp and the fill %, not a window length. So
    `src/lib/pace.ts` derives the window length from the tier name — **exactly** for recognizable fixed
    windows ("5h Window" → 300 min, "4-hour" → 240, "Weekly" → 10 080; "hourly"/"daily" words) and **`null`**
    for everything else ("Monthly" is calendar-variable, "Sonnet only"/"Designs"/"Daily Routines" are
    nicknames). It **never** assumes a default window — the Mac's C3 fix showed an assumed window yields a
    wrong pace, so we show *no* pace rather than a misleading one. `computePace` (linear expected-fraction vs.
    a 5-pp on-track band) + `windowMinutesForTier` + `parseResetMs` are pure and fully unit-tested (14 cases).
  - The marker reuses `placeOnRemainingBar`, so it's consistent with the warning ticks. New `providers.pace_*`
    keys across all 3 locales; the three status labels are pinned in the critical-labels gate. Pace is only
    shown for tiers with a known window **and** a reset timestamp, so unnamed / flat-quota bars are unchanged.

- **Per-provider prompt-cache hit rate on the Overview** — the Overview provider-usage breakdown now shows a
  compact **"N% cache"** per provider row (its `cached ÷ (input + cached)` over the scan window), next to the
  I/O-token and cost columns, so you can see which providers benefit most from prompt caching — not just the
  single account-wide figure. Closes `DEV_PLAN_2026-07-08_desktop_next_phase.md` §3 P0.2 (extends the A6
  cache-hit analytics into the breakdown).
  - Frontend-only, no Rust/wire change: the raw `input_tokens` + `cached_tokens` already reach the frontend on
    each `DailyEntry`; the Overview `byProvider` reducer now sums them per provider. The cache-rate formula is
    factored into a single pure `cacheHitRateOf(input, cached)` helper in `src/lib/activity.ts` (the existing
    account-wide `cacheHitRate` now delegates to it; +3 Vitest cases). Reuses the existing `overview.cache_hit`
    / `overview.cache_hit_hint` keys — no new i18n strings. The chip's column slot is kept even when a provider
    has no cache data, so the token/cost columns stay aligned.

- **Date-range picker (7 / 30 / 90 / custom)** — the local usage scan window is no longer hard-wired to 30
  days. A new **Settings → Date range** selector (one-tap 7/30/90 presets plus a custom 1–180 day field)
  drives the whole local-scan surface — Overview tiles, the activity heat strip + streaks, the provider-usage
  breakdown, the Providers-tab per-provider aggregation, the entries table, and the CSV/JSON export — because
  they all key off `scan.days_scanned`. Closes the deferred v0.10.0 date-range item
  (`DEV_PLAN_2026-07-08_desktop_next_phase.md` §3 P0.1).
  - **Client-local, no schema change:** the choice persists in `localStorage` (`cli-pulse.date-range-days`),
    mirroring the display-currency pattern. The pure window-math (`clampDays` / `isPreset` / load / save) lives
    in `src/lib/dateRange.ts` (14 Vitest cases) and mirrors the backend's own `scan_usage(days).clamp(1, 180)`
    so the two never disagree. Exposed app-wide via a small `ScanRangeContext`; `runScan` reads it and re-scans
    on change from a dedicated effect (so a range flip does **not** re-run the config/sessions/alerts refetch or
    the one-shot update check). New `settings.range_*` keys across all 3 locales, `settings.range_heading`
    pinned in the critical-labels gate.
  - **Scope note:** the fixed "Last 7 days" cost trend chart (7-day by design) and the paired, server-backed
    30-day per-provider history sparkline (its own `get_daily_usage` window, server-clamped to 90) keep their
    own windows — they're semantically distinct from the local-scan date range.

- **Multi-currency cost display (USD / CNY / EUR / GBP / JPY)** — costs are computed and stored in **USD**
  everywhere, but you can now pick a **display currency** in Settings and every cost figure converts to it
  (Overview tiles, provider breakdown, forecast, top-projects, trend chart, model tables, entries table).
  Learned from `javis603/token-monitor`'s multi-currency support (`DEV_PLAN_2026-07-07_competitive_learnings.md`
  §3a A2).
  - **FX rates** are fetched by a new Rust `fx` module from `open.er-api.com` (free, no API key,
    daily-updated), cached ~6 h; **read-only public data** — the request sends nothing about the user, and
    on a fetch failure the last good rates (or plain USD) are served so a cost never blanks. Override the
    source with `FX_RATES_URL`. `src-tauri/src/fx.rs` (4 parse tests) + a `get_fx_rates` command.
  - **Frontend:** `src/lib/money.ts` `formatMoney` (deterministic — no ICU-dependent `Intl` currency
    formatting — so it's unit-tested; 7 tests) + a `MoneyContext` providing `fmt(usd)` app-wide, so
    changing the currency re-renders every cost. USD keeps its existing sub-cent precision; a missing rate
    falls back to USD. The choice persists in `localStorage`. New **Settings → Display currency** selector;
    2 i18n keys × 3 locales (heading pinned).
  - **Note:** exports (CSV/JSON) stay in **USD** deliberately — they're data, not display.

- **Cache hit-rate on the Overview** — the Overview activity row now shows the prompt-**cache hit rate**
  over the scan window (`cached ÷ (input + cached)` tokens), so you can see how much prompt caching is
  saving you (learned from `javis603/token-monitor`'s cache-hit analytics,
  `DEV_PLAN_2026-07-07_competitive_learnings.md` §3a A6). Pure `cacheHitRate` helper in `src/lib/activity.ts`
  (3 tests; `null` when there are no input+cached tokens, so a message-only window hides the chip) + a muted
  chip alongside the streaks + 1 i18n key × 3 locales (pinned).

- **Adaptive background-sync cadence (power-aware)** — the background sync/quota loop now backs off on
  battery to save power + provider rate-limit budget: **120 s on AC**, **5 min on battery**, **15 min when
  the battery is low** (≤20% and discharging). Learned from CodexBar's Low-Power-aware polling
  (`DEV_PLAN_2026-07-07_competitive_learnings.md` §3b B1; the thermal + window-focus dimensions are
  deferred). Read via `starship-battery` once per cycle (battery state changes slowly, so tick-boundary
  adaptation is fine); any read failure / no battery → the fast 120 s cadence, so desktops, VMs, and CI
  runners are unaffected. `adaptive_sync_interval` / `PowerHint` are pure + unit-tested (mapping +
  monotonic back-off); both `wait_for_next_tick` call sites now compute the interval per cycle.

- **Activity strip + usage streaks on the Overview** — a compact per-day heat strip over the local scan
  window (last `days_scanned` days) plus **current** and **longest** usage streaks, learned from
  `javis603/token-monitor`'s home-screen heatmap + streaks (`DEV_PLAN_2026-07-07_competitive_learnings.md`
  §3a A4/A5). Local-scan only, so it works unpaired; hidden when the whole window is idle. A day counts as
  active when it has any tokens **or** any messages (so a Claude-only day, whose tokens live in a separate
  message bucket, still counts); heat level is quartile-bucketed against the window's busiest day. The
  current streak has a one-day grace so an unfinished "today" doesn't zero a live streak.
  - `src/lib/activity.ts` (`buildActivity` / `computeStreaks` / `activityLevel` — pure, timezone-safe via
    an injectable `from` date) + `src/lib/activity.test.ts` (10 tests) + an `ActivitySection` on the
    Overview + 5 i18n keys × 3 locales (3 pinned in the critical-labels gate).

- **WSL usage merge on Windows** — Windows developers often run Claude Code / Codex **inside a WSL
  distro**, where the logs live under the Linux home (`/home/<user>/.claude`, …) that the native Windows
  scanner never saw. We now enumerate the home dirs of **running** WSL distros (via the
  `\\wsl.localhost\<distro>\` UNC share) and scan them alongside the native roots, so that usage **merges
  into the same per-provider totals**. Learned from `javis603/token-monitor` (see
  `DEV_PLAN_2026-07-07_competitive_learnings.md` §3a A1 — the top P0 gap).
  - Running-distros-only (`wsl.exe -l --running -q`) so a stopped distro's file server isn't woken on every
    scan; best-effort + fail-safe (no `wsl.exe` / nothing running / unreadable share → empty list), so
    macOS/Linux and Windows-without-WSL are completely unaffected. Docker/Rancher internal distros are
    skipped; the `wsl.exe` spawn uses `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (no console flash); only the `\\wsl.localhost\`
    prefix is used (never the aliased `\\wsl$\`) so a distro is never double-counted.
  - `src-tauri/src/wsl.rs` (5 unit tests — UTF-16LE distro-list parse with BOM/CRLF, blank + internal-distro
    filtering, empty output, names-with-spaces, off-Windows empty) + `paths.rs` appends each WSL home's
    `.claude`/`.codex` roots to the scan lists. The scanner + cache merge them automatically (distinct
    path keys, same day/model buckets).
  - **Verification posture:** the UTF-16 parse / filtering / path construction is unit-tested; the **live
    WSL merge needs a Windows VM with a running WSL distro** (not CI-verifiable — the Windows CI runner has
    no WSL). The pure functions are covered; distro enumeration + FS access is Windows-only `cfg` code.

- **Abacus AI compute-points collector** (port of macOS `AbacusCollector`, derived from steipete/CodexBar,
  MIT). Adds Abacus AI as a **33rd provider** — a second cookie-authed MEDIUM collector. Two calls run
  concurrently: a required `GET apps.abacus.ai/api/_getOrganizationComputePoints`
  (`totalComputePoints` / `computePointsLeft`) and a best-effort `POST /api/_getBillingInfo`
  (`nextBillingDate` / `currentTier`) bounded to a **5s per-request timeout** so it can never stall the
  required render. Auth: the whole resolved **`Cookie:` header** is sent as-is (no token extraction, unlike
  Manus), from env `ABACUS_COOKIE` / `ABACUS_SESSION_TOKEN` or the Settings `abacus_cookie`. Both endpoints
  use a `{success, result}` envelope; a 401/403 or an auth-flavored `error` message surfaces as an error
  (the auth-keyword set is tightened — no bare "session"/"expired" — to avoid false re-auth prompts). A
  positive cap maps to a real **`.quota`** ("Compute Points" gauge, `status_text` "left/total compute
  points"); a degenerate `total ≤ 0` degrades to status-only. `plan_type` = the title-cased billing tier
  or "Account".
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/abacus.rs` (6 unit tests — quota + billing tier, left-clamped-to-total,
    degenerate→status-only, success-envelope unwrap, auth-status + auth-vs-non-auth message routing,
    missing-fields rejection) + `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_ABACUS = "Abacus AI"` in both
    contract-test arrays (case `"abacus"`). `abacus_cookie` cred through `provider_creds` + **Settings →
    Integrations** cookie input row + 2 i18n keys × 3 locales.
  - **Divergence from the Mac:** no browser cookie auto-import (manual paste / env only).
  - **Verification posture:** envelope unwrap / auth routing / compute-point mapping fully unit-tested; the
    live fetch needs a real Abacus session cookie (not CI-verifiable) — ported from the proven Mac collector.

- **Manus credit-pool collector** (port of macOS `ManusCollector`, derived from steipete/CodexBar, MIT).
  Adds Manus as a **32nd provider** — the first **cookie**-authed collector of the MEDIUM tranche. A single
  `POST https://api.manus.im/user.v1.UserService/GetAvailableCredits` (Connect-RPC, JSON body `{}`). Auth
  novelty: the **`session_id` cookie value is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <value>`** (not a `Cookie:`
  header); the cookie comes from env `MANUS_SESSION_TOKEN` / `MANUS_SESSION_ID` / `MANUS_COOKIE` or the
  Settings `manus_cookie` (manual paste — the desktop has no browser auto-import). A token extractor pulls
  the `session_id` value from a full Cookie header, accepts a bare token, and (for a lone base64 value)
  treats trailing `=` padding as non-cookie-syntax while rejecting a stray `name=value` pair. Manus returns
  two capped pools (monthly pro + periodic refresh) → a real **`.quota`**: the monthly pool (else the
  refresh pool) drives the headline gauge, the refresh pool is a secondary tier; neither capped degrades to
  a status-only balance. Envelope-tolerant parse (`data`/`result`/`response`/`availableCredits`) with a
  "require ≥1 known credits key" guard so an error payload can't decode to an all-zero snapshot; lossy
  number decode (number|int|string). `status_text` = "Balance: N credits" (+ a refresh detail);
  `plan_type` = "Pro"/"Free" inferred from the monthly pool.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/manus.rs` (7 unit tests — monthly-primary + refresh-secondary, refresh-only,
    status-only, envelope unwrap, unrelated-payload rejection, lossy string numbers, session-token
    extraction incl. base64 padding + stray-pair rejection) + `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_MANUS =
    "Manus"` in both contract-test arrays (case `"manus"`). `manus_cookie` cred through `provider_creds` +
    **Settings → Integrations** cookie input row + 2 i18n keys × 3 locales.
  - **Divergence from the Mac:** no browser cookie auto-import (manual paste / env only).
  - **Verification posture:** token extraction / envelope parse / pool mapping fully unit-tested; the live
    fetch needs a real Manus session cookie (not CI-verifiable) — ported from the proven Mac collector.

- **Codebuff credit-quota collector** (port of macOS `CodebuffCollector`, derived from steipete/CodexBar,
  MIT). Adds Codebuff as a **31st provider** — the first of the MEDIUM (multi-call) tranche. A required
  `POST https://www.codebuff.com/api/v1/usage` (body `{"fingerprintId":"clipulse-usage"}`, Bearer) returns
  credits used/total/remaining + next reset; a best-effort `GET /api/user/subscription` adds a weekly
  window + plan tier. The two run **concurrently** (`tokio::join!`), with the subscription bounded to a
  **2-second per-request timeout** so a slow secondary can never stall the required usage render (mirrors
  the Mac's grace window) — a subscription failure/timeout just drops the weekly enrichment. Credits have
  a hard cap + reset, so a positive total maps to a real **`.quota`** ("Credits" gauge); a degenerate
  `total ≤ 0` falls back to status-only (a 0/healthy gauge would mislead). Flexible JSON throughout
  (number|string amounts; ISO8601 | epoch-seconds | epoch-millis reset dates). `status_text` = "N credits
  remaining" (+ " · auto top-up" when enabled); `plan_type` = the title-cased subscription tier or
  "API key".
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/codebuff.rs` (6 unit tests — quota gauge + auto-top-up, total derived from
    used+remaining with string numbers, weekly tier + title-cased plan, degenerate→status-only, epoch-ms
    reset, compact-credits formatting) + `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_CODEBUFF = "Codebuff"` in both
    contract-test arrays (case `"codebuff"`). `codebuff_api_key` cred through `provider_creds` + **Settings
    → Integrations** input row + 2 i18n keys × 3 locales.
  - **Divergence from the Mac:** the auth-file token fallback (`~/.codebuff/…`) is not ported (env +
    Settings is the documented path).
  - **Verification posture:** parse / derivations / tier / formatting fully unit-tested; the live fetch
    needs a real Codebuff key (not CI-verifiable) — ported from the proven Mac collector.

- **OpenAI Admin org-spend collector** (port of macOS `OpenAIAdminCollector`, itself derived from
  steipete/CodexBar, MIT). Adds OpenAI Admin as a **30th provider** — and **completes the api-key-REST
  batch** of remaining Mac collectors (ElevenLabs, Ollama, Kilo, Alibaba, OpenAI Admin all ported). A
  single `GET api.openai.com/v1/organization/costs?start_time&end_time&bucket_width=1d&limit=31`,
  `Authorization: Bearer <admin key>`, summing the month-to-date daily cost buckets. This is the
  **organization cost admin API** — DISTINCT from CLI Pulse's existing Codex provider (the Codex CLI); it
  needs an **org admin key** (`sk-admin-…`), a regular `sk-` key 401s. Status-only (`quota`/`remaining` =
  0, no tiers): `status_text` = "$X this month" (or "CUR X this month" for a non-USD org), `plan_type =
  "Admin API"`. Like the Mac (which notes the admin API "occasionally 503s under load"), the idempotent
  GET is retried **once** on a transient failure (network error / 408 / 429 / 5xx).
  - **Divergence from the Mac:** drops the ubiquitous `OPENAI_API_KEY` env fallback (a desktop GUI app
    doesn't inherit shell env, and a non-admin `OPENAI_API_KEY` would just 401 forever) — reads only
    `OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY` or the Settings `openai_admin_key`; a 401/403 is a genuine "wrong key" error.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/openai_admin.rs` (5 unit tests — bucket summing across results, empty-data zero,
    flexible string-amount + non-USD currency, missing-data schema error, UTC month-start) + `collect_all`
    wiring + `PROVIDER_OPENAI_ADMIN = "OpenAI Admin"` in both contract-test arrays (case `"openaiAdmin"`).
    `openai_admin_key` cred through `provider_creds` + **Settings → Integrations** input row + 2 i18n keys
    × 3 locales.
  - Reviewed for wire-format fidelity against the Mac twin (adversarial workflow, sonnet); the one finding
    (missing transient-retry) is folded into this collector.
  - **Verification posture:** parse / sum / month-window / retry logic fully unit-tested; the live cost
    fetch needs a real org admin key (not CI-verifiable) — endpoint/auth ported from the proven Mac
    collector.

- **Alibaba coding-plan quota collector** (port of macOS `AlibabaCollector`). Adds Alibaba as a **29th
  provider** — a real multi-window `.quota`. `POST {host}/data/api.json?action=…queryCodingPlanInstanceInfoV2`
  authed with a Bearer token that is also mirrored into `x-api-key` + `X-DashScope-API-Key` (as the Mac
  does), from env `ALIBABA_CODING_PLAN_API_KEY` or the Settings `alibaba_api_key`. **Region routing:** the
  International console (`modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com`, commodity `broadscope-bailian-intl`) is
  tried first, falling back to China mainland (`bailian.console.aliyun.com`, `broadscope-bailian`) on any
  failure — mirrors the Mac do/catch. Parses `data.codingPlanInstanceInfos[0]` into up to three windows
  (**5-hour / weekly / monthly**), each `used`/`total` with a next-refresh reset. The 5-hour window (else
  monthly) drives the headline gauge; `status_text` shows "used/total used"; `plan_type` is `planName`
  (or `packageName`, default "Coding Plan").
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/alibaba.rs` (4 unit tests — three-window mapping + 5h headline, monthly-headline
    fallback + `packageName`, no-quota-info "Unknown"/default-plan, missing-infos schema error) +
    `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_ALIBABA = "Alibaba"` in both contract-test arrays (case `"alibaba"`).
    `alibaba_api_key` cred through `provider_creds` + **Settings → Integrations** input row + 2 i18n keys
    × 3 locales.
  - **Verification posture:** region routing / parse / window mapping fully unit-tested; the live POST
    needs a real Alibaba coding-plan key so it can't be CI-verified — endpoint/auth/region-fallback ported
    from the proven Mac collector.

- **Kilo credit + subscription collector** (port of macOS `KiloCollector`). Adds Kilo as a **28th
  provider**. A single **tRPC batch** GET
  `https://app.kilo.ai/api/trpc/user.getCreditBlocks,kiloPass.getState?batch=1` (two procedures, one
  request → JSON array of two `{result:{data:{json:…}}}` envelopes) authed with `Authorization: Bearer`.
  Token resolves from env `KILO_API_KEY`, the Settings `kilo_api_key`, **or** the Kilo CLI session file
  `~/.local/share/kilo/auth.json` (`json.kilo.access`) so CLI users get it zero-config. Money arrives as
  **micro-USD** integers; the display convention mirrors the Mac (micro-USD → USD ÷1e6 → display units at
  `$1 = 100_000`, truncating like Swift `Int()`) so a dual-writer converges on the shared row. A
  **Credits** tier (summed credit blocks) + optional **Kilo Pass** subscription tier (base+bonus − usage,
  with `nextBillingAt` reset); `plan_type` maps `tier_19/49/199` → Starter/Pro/Expert (unknown tiers pass
  through). The readable dollar figure lives in `status_text` "$remaining / $total" since the ×100_000
  units are meaningless raw.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/kilo.rs` (5 unit tests — block summing + display scale, Credits/Kilo-Pass tier
    build, credits-only-no-subscription, unknown-tier passthrough + empty-credits zero-quota,
    non-array-body schema error) + `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_KILO = "Kilo"` in both contract-test
    arrays (case `"kilo"`). `kilo_api_key` cred through `provider_creds` + **Settings → Integrations**
    input row + 2 i18n keys × 3 locales.
  - **Verification posture:** parse / scale / tier / plan-map fully unit-tested; the live tRPC fetch needs
    a real Kilo key so it can't be CI-verified — endpoint/auth ported from the proven Mac collector.

- **Ollama local-server status collector** (port of macOS `OllamaCollector`). Adds Ollama as a **27th
  provider** — and the **only credential-free one**: it probes the local Ollama daemon, so a developer
  running Ollama gets it **zero-config** (no Settings row, no key). `GET http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
  (installed models) + best-effort `/api/ps` (running) — override the base with `OLLAMA_HOST`. Ollama has
  no quota model, so it's **status-only** (`quota`/`remaining` = 0, no tiers): the whole signal is the
  `status_text` line "N running, M installed" (or "M models installed" when idle), `plan_type = "Local"`.
  The Mac's raw `AF_INET` socket pre-probe is replaced with a plain short-timeout `reqwest` GET whose
  **connection error is the "not running" signal** → the collector returns `Ok(None)` (provider absent,
  no error badge) rather than failing. Because it rides the existing status-only render path, it needs no
  frontend, cred, or i18n changes — just the collector + `collect_all` wiring.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/ollama.rs` (3 unit tests — model-name parse skips unnamed entries, missing
    `models` key is empty-not-error, running/idle `status_text` forms) + `collect_all` wiring +
    `PROVIDER_OLLAMA = "Ollama"` in both contract-test arrays (case `"ollama"`).
  - **Verification posture:** parse + status-text fully unit-tested; the live probe hits `localhost:11434`
    so it's exercised whenever a dev has Ollama running (CI has none → `Ok(None)`, correctly absent).

- **ElevenLabs character-quota collector** (port of macOS `ElevenLabsCollector`). Adds ElevenLabs as a
  **26th provider** and opens the api-key REST batch of remaining Mac collectors with the highest-value
  one: a **real depleting `.quota`** (not status-only). A single `GET /v1/user/subscription` — authed
  with the custom **`xi-api-key`** header (NOT `Authorization: Bearer`), env `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` /
  `XI_API_KEY` or Settings — returns the monthly **character** cap. Mapped to `remaining =
  max(0, character_limit − character_count)`, `quota = character_limit`, renewal from
  `next_character_count_reset_unix`, plus optional **Voice slots** / **Professional voices** sub-tiers.
  The local status line reads "X / Y characters" (+ a "(Overage: amount currency)" suffix when billing
  overage is present); `plan_type` is the title-cased tier with a "· {status}" suffix for non-active
  subscriptions.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/elevenlabs.rs` (5 unit tests — quota + voice-tier mapping, overage suffix,
    `display_tier` variants incl. active-suppression, no-limit → "API key" fallback, thousands grouping)
    + `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_ELEVENLABS = "ElevenLabs"` in both contract-test arrays (case
    `"elevenLabs"`). `elevenlabs_api_key` cred through `provider_creds` + a **Settings → Integrations**
    input row (+2 i18n keys × 3 locales).
  - **Verification posture:** parse / quota-map / tier / formatting fully unit-tested; the **live fetch
    needs a real ElevenLabs key so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/auth ported from the proven Mac
    collector. Configure a key in Settings to exercise it live.

- **Deepgram usage collector** (v0.17 — port of macOS `DeepgramCollector`, status-only). Adds Deepgram
  as a 25th provider — and **completes the status-only batch** (GLM, Volcano, Groq, Mistral, Deepgram all
  ported). Deepgram exposes no quota/credits denominator — only absolute usage counts — so it's
  status-only: "N requests · X audio hrs · N tokens". Auth uses the custom **`Token`** scheme (not
  Bearer) — env `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` or Settings. A pinned `DEEPGRAM_PROJECT_ID` → one usage call;
  otherwise `GET /v1/projects` then a capped (≤5), **concurrent** per-project
  `GET /v1/projects/{id}/usage/breakdown`, aggregated across projects (`plan_type` becomes "N projects" /
  the single project name / "API key").
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/deepgram.rs` (7 unit tests — projects parse, usage sum, cross-project combine,
    status-text with billable-hrs / TTS-chars fallbacks, plan-type selection, decimal grouping) +
    `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_DEEPGRAM = "Deepgram"`. The concurrent fan-out uses `tokio::spawn`
    (annotated; async context). `deepgram_api_key` cred through `provider_creds` + a **Settings →
    Integrations** input row (+2 i18n keys × 3).
  - **Verification posture:** projects/usage parsing / aggregation / formatting fully unit-tested; the
    **live fetch needs a real Deepgram key so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoints/auth ported from the
    proven Mac collector. Configure a key in Settings to exercise it live.

- **Mistral spend collector** (v0.17 — port of macOS `MistralCollector`, status-only). Adds Mistral as a
  24th provider. Mistral is pay-as-you-go (no quota cap, no balance), so it's status-only carrying an
  EXACT month-to-date **spend**, computed from `tokens × price`: reads a session cookie (Settings paste,
  or env `MISTRAL_COOKIE` / `MISTRAL_SESSION_TOKEN`; the header must contain an `ory_session_*` cookie,
  and a `csrftoken` cookie is echoed as `X-CSRFTOKEN`), fetches
  `GET admin.mistral.ai/api/billing/v2/usage?month&year` (current UTC month), builds a `metric::group →
  price` index, and aggregates cost + tokens across all billing categories (completion / ocr / connectors
  / audio / libraries / fine-tuning). Status line: "€X.XXXX this month · N tokens".
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/mistral.rs` (5 unit tests — ory_session/csrf extraction, cost+token aggregation
    with the price index, value_paid-preferred, missing-price → 0, thousands grouping) + `collect_all`
    wiring + `PROVIDER_MISTRAL = "Mistral"`. New `mistral_cookie` cred through `provider_creds` + a
    **Settings → Integrations** cookie-paste row (+2 i18n keys × 3).
  - **Verification posture:** billing-tree aggregation / price index / formatting fully unit-tested; the
    **live fetch needs a real Mistral session cookie so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/auth ported
    from the proven Mac collector. Paste a cookie in Settings to exercise it live.

- **Groq throughput collector** (v0.17 — port of macOS `GroqCollector`, status-only). Adds Groq (the
  inference company; NOT xAI's Grok) as a 23rd provider. Groq exposes only a **Prometheus** metrics
  endpoint with throughput RATES — no quota/cost/balance — so it's status-only: reads the api-key
  (Settings, or env `GROQ_API_KEY`), runs **4 concurrent PromQL rate queries** against
  `{base}/metrics/prometheus/api/v1/query` (base via env `GROQ_API_URL`), and reports a live
  `status_text` line "X req/min · Y tok/min" (+ "· Z cache/min" when non-zero). No gauge is drawn.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/groq.rs` (6 unit tests — Prometheus instant-envelope parse with mixed
    number/string values, empty-result → 0, non-success → error, per-minute rate formatting with the
    ≥100/≥10/else precision buckets) + `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_GROQ = "Groq"`. `groq_api_key`
    cred through `provider_creds` + a **Settings → Integrations** input row (+2 i18n keys × 3).
  - **Verification posture:** Prometheus parsing / rate formatting fully unit-tested; the **live fetch
    needs a real Groq key so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/queries/auth ported from the proven Mac
    collector. Configure a key in Settings to exercise it live.

- **Volcano Engine (火山引擎 / 豆包) Ark collector** (v0.17 — port of macOS `VolcanoEngineCollector`).
  Adds Volcano Engine as a 22nd provider. **Dual-mode:** when the Ark response carries `{total,
  remaining}` it renders a real **"Ark Plan"** quota gauge ("700/1000 used"); otherwise the models-list
  endpoint is a connectivity probe and it degrades to a status-only line ("N models available" /
  "Connected") via `status_text`, with no gauge. Reads the api-key (Settings, or env `ARK_API_KEY` /
  `VOLC_ACCESSKEY` / `VOLCANO_ENGINE_API_KEY`), fetches `GET ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3/models`
  (host overridable via `ARK_API_HOST`), and parses three shapes (top-level quota, models array,
  `result`/`Response` wrapper) in the Mac's precedence order.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/volcano.rs` (6 shape / gauge / status unit tests) + `collect_all` wiring +
    `PROVIDER_VOLCANO = "Volcano Engine"` (validated against the Mac `ProviderKind` snapshot).
    `volcano_api_key` cred through `provider_creds` + a **Settings → Integrations** input row
    (+2 i18n keys × 3).
  - **Verification posture:** shape detection / gauge / status formatting fully unit-tested; the **live
    fetch needs a real Ark key so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/auth ported from the proven Mac
    collector. Configure a key in Settings to exercise it live.

- **GLM (Zhipu / 智谱) status-only collector** (v0.17 — port of macOS `GLMCollector`, the first
  status-only provider). Adds GLM as a 21st provider, now that the `status_text` line gives status-only
  providers a render path. GLM has no quota/limit endpoint, so it's a **connectivity probe**: reads the
  api-key (Settings → Integrations, or env `GLM_API_KEY` / `ZHIPU_API_KEY` / `CHATGLM_API_KEY`), fetches
  `GET open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/models`, and reports a `status_text` only — `"N models available"`,
  `"X.XX CUR remaining"` when a balance shape comes back, else `"Connected"`. No numeric gauge is drawn
  (`quota`/`remaining` = 0, `tiers` empty) — the card shows just the status line. Host overridable via
  env `GLM_API_HOST`.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/glm.rs` (5 shape-detection / status-format unit tests) + `collect_all` wiring +
    `PROVIDER_GLM = "GLM"` (validated against the Mac `ProviderKind` snapshot). `glm_api_key` cred through
    `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file + migration + wipe) + a **Settings → Integrations** input row
    (+2 i18n keys × 3).
  - **Verification posture:** shape detection / status formatting fully unit-tested; the **live fetch
    needs a real GLM key so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/auth ported from the proven Mac
    collector. Configure a key in Settings to exercise it live.

- **Provider `status_text` — a readable local status line** (v0.17 — macOS parity, ports the Mac
  `ProviderUsage.status_text`). Fixes the long-standing balance-display gap: uncapped-balance providers
  (DeepSeek, Moonshot, Venice, Kimi K2, Crof credits) rendered their gauge as a raw scaled integer
  ("1234" cents, "500000" units) with no currency — meaningless to read. Each such collector now emits a
  human-readable line ("$12.34 balance", "Balance: $5.00", "$12.34 USD balance", "5.00 / 8.00 credits",
  "$12.00 credits · 750 requests left"), rendered as a muted secondary line on the provider card. Grok's
  status-only fallback now shows "Connected" instead of an empty 0/0 gauge.
  - **LOCAL-ONLY, never synced** — verified against both repos: the Mac's `helper_sync` RPC and the
    Supabase `provider_quotas` table have no `status_text` column (the Mac even hardcodes "Operational"
    for cloud-fetched rows), so the desktop keeps it display-only. `QuotaSnapshot` gains
    `status_text: Option<String>` (`skip_serializing_if` None), surfaced to the frontend via the existing
    `get_last_collector_status` channel (`CollectorStatusView.status_text`) — NOT added to the
    `p_provider_tiers` upload payload.
  - **Rust:** `status_text` threaded through all 21 collector `QuotaSnapshot` literals (populated on the
    balance/status-only ones, `None` on real-gauge providers to avoid a redundant line under the bar) +
    6 new test assertions pinning the exact format strings. **React:** `CollectorStatus.status_text` type
    + a conditional muted line on the provider card, sourced from `statusByProvider` (the same map that
    drives the error badge). This is the foundation that unblocks the deferred status-only providers
    (GLM, Volcano Engine, Groq, Mistral, Deepgram), which now have a meaningful way to render.

- **Alert lifecycle** (macOS parity — ports `AlertsTab.swift`). When
  paired, the Alerts tab now shows persisted SERVER alerts with an
  Open / Resolved / All filter, severity summary badges, a Resolve-all
  button, and per-row Acknowledge / Resolve / Snooze (15/30/60/120 min)
  actions — replacing the read-only client-computed preview for signed-in
  users. Unpaired users keep the local-preview path unchanged (those
  alerts aren't persisted, so there's nothing to act on). Snoozed alerts
  drop out of the Open filter until their snooze expires.
  - **Rust**: `list_alerts` (fetches open + resolved) plus
    `resolve_alert` / `acknowledge_alert` / `snooze_alert` commands —
    direct PostgREST PATCH to the `alerts` table (RLS-scoped), mirroring
    the Mac's `APIClient`. `ServerAlert` gains `acknowledged_at` /
    `snoozed_until` (serde-default, back-compatible with the v0.5.3
    unresolved fetch).
  - **Frontend**: new `ServerAlertsPanel` + `ServerAlertCard`, reusing
    the SVG `SeverityIcon` and brand-color provider chips. 14 alert
    i18n keys × 3 langs; critical labels pinned in the gate.
- **Swarm tab** (macOS/iOS parity — ports `SwarmTab.swift`). New 6th
  tab: a live, attention-sorted grid of every parallel agent swarm the
  user's paired devices are heart-beating (blocked-first, then by agent
  count). Each card shows the opaque `swarm-<6hex>` handle, agent /
  blocked counts, oldest-blocked age, brand-colored provider chips, a
  worktree marker, and a stale "last seen" line; the header rolls up
  "N swarms · N agents · N blocked" (amber when any are blocked).
  Self-polls every 10 s while paired. Distinct empty states for
  not-paired / Remote-Control-off / no-swarms / load-error.
  - **Rust**: `remote_list_swarms` `#[tauri::command]` + `RemoteSwarm`
    / `RemoteSwarmDevice` serde structs wrapping the existing
    `remote_app_list_swarms` RPC (no Supabase change). 2 round-trip
    unit tests. No repo/branch name crosses the wire (handle is an
    opaque HMAC) — privacy posture matches the Mac.
  - **Frontend**: `secondsToShortParts` helper added to `format.ts`
    (3 tests) for localized age strings; keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd+4`
    now selects Swarm (Alerts→5, Settings→6). 16 swarm i18n keys × 3
    langs; critical labels pinned in the gate.

- **Per-provider visibility filter** (Providers tab). A chip row above
  the provider cards lets users mute providers they don't track; a
  muted (line-through) chip hides that card. The choice persists to
  `localStorage` under `cli-pulse.hidden-providers` as the *hidden*
  set — a provider that only starts reporting usage later defaults to
  visible rather than being silently filtered out. The cost bars
  rescale to the visible set, and an "all hidden" state offers a
  one-click "Show all" back. The filter row only appears when there's
  more than one provider to choose between.
- **`src/lib/providerVisibility.ts`** new module — `loadHiddenProviders`
  / `saveHiddenProviders` / `toggleHiddenProvider`. Load fails open
  (missing key, malformed JSON, non-array payload, or non-string
  entries all collapse to an empty set); save is best-effort
  (quota / privacy-mode denials are swallowed). 10 unit tests in
  `providerVisibility.test.ts`.
- **5 i18n keys × 3 langs** (`providers.visibility_label`,
  `visibility_show_all`, `visibility_hide_tooltip`,
  `visibility_show_tooltip`, `all_hidden`) — all pinned in
  `i18n.test.ts`'s critical-labels gate.
- **Per-provider brand colors + avatars** (Providers tab — macOS/iOS
  parity). Each provider card now carries its brand accent as a 3px
  left stripe plus a colored monogram avatar, and the visibility-filter
  chips show a matching color dot. Closes the audit's most-repeated
  visual gap ("Claude / Codex / Gemini are indistinguishable").
- **`src/lib/providerTheme.ts`** new module — the 29-provider accent
  palette ported 1:1 from the Mac app's `PulseTheme.providerColor`
  (RGB→hex), plus `providerColor` (case-insensitive, gray fallback) and
  `providerMonogram`. Reusable by sessions / alerts / tray in later
  ships. 9 unit tests. No new i18n (color + monogram are non-textual).
- **Provider brand-color dots on Sessions rows** (macOS parity) — each
  live-session row's provider cell now leads with its brand-color dot,
  reusing `providerTheme`.
- **Alerts card polish** (macOS parity) — replaced the emoji severity
  glyph with the existing SVG `SeverityIcon` (emoji render as fixed
  multicolor on Win/Linux and ignore CSS color), and rendered the
  related-entity metadata as chips: provider (with brand-color dot),
  project, plus the previously-unused **session** and **device** fields.
  2 new i18n keys (`misc.session_label`, `misc.device_label`) × 3 langs,
  pinned in the critical-labels gate.
- **Provider usage breakdown on Overview** (macOS parity — OverviewTab
  costSection). A new section ranks providers by I/O tokens with
  brand-colored bars (reuses `providerTheme`), computed from the local
  N-day scan so it works offline; cost shown as a secondary figure.
  Ranks by tokens (not cost) so flat-rate subscription usage — where
  cost is $0 — still shows a meaningful breakdown. 1 new i18n key
  (`overview.provider_usage_title`) × 3 langs, pinned.
- **System Monitor — "Machine" tab** (v1.38 parity, macOS System Monitor
  Phase 1). A new 4th tab (after Sessions) with an Activity-Monitor-style
  local cockpit: whole-machine **CPU** and **memory** gauges plus a live
  **top-N process table** (name / PID / CPU% / memory), refreshed every 2s.
  - **First principles:** the Mac reads Apple-only SMC / IOReport / HID for
    temps / fans / power; the portable subset Windows *and* Linux can always
    read without privileges is CPU / memory / per-process, so that's this
    slice. Temperatures + battery (`sysinfo` `Components` / a battery crate)
    are a capability-gated follow-up — this reports only what the platform
    can truthfully read, no fabricated sensor values.
  - **`src-tauri/src/machine.rs`** + `get_machine_snapshot` command (via
    `sysinfo`, already a dep — no new crates, no privileges). Per-process
    CPU% is normalized to share-of-machine (÷ core count) so it shares the
    0–100 scale with the gauge. Every percentage is NaN/Inf-scrubbed +
    clamped in Rust so a bad sample can't render `undefined` (the v0.2.11
    lesson). +4 Rust tests.
  - **LOCAL only** — per-process rows are **never** synced to Supabase
    (privacy + volume); there is no wire path here, unlike sessions /
    heartbeat.
  - **`formatBytes`** helper added to `format.ts` (+2 tests). Keyboard
    shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd+4` now selects Machine (Swarm→5, Alerts→6,
    Settings→7); shortcut help overlay updated. 15 i18n keys × 3 langs
    (`tab.machine`, `shortcuts.tab_machine`, `machine.*`), pinned in the
    critical-labels gate.
  - **Temperatures + battery** (capability-gated). Temps via `sysinfo`
    `Components` (Linux hwmon / Windows WMI / macOS SMC — no new dep);
    battery via `starship-battery` (pure-Rust, no privileges; the only new
    crate). Both are **truthful**: a temp is shown only if it reads finite +
    in `-40..150 °C`, the temps section is hidden when the platform exposes
    none (common on Windows consumer HW / VMs), and battery is `null` (card
    hidden) when there's no battery — never a fabricated reading. Battery
    colour is inverted (low charge = danger; charging = green); temps use a
    warm palette. 7 more i18n keys × 3 langs, pinned.
  - **Verification:** the tab-traversal smoke below renders every tab in CI,
    so the Machine tab's render path is exercised headlessly on
    Windows + Linux (no VM needed for a render-crash regression). On-device
    sensor *values* (real temps/battery) still warrant a laptop pass.
- **Cross-device heartbeat** (`helper_heartbeat`, macOS/mobile parity). The
  120s sync tick now reports this machine's **whole-device CPU% / memory% +
  active-session count** to the `devices` row, so the user's **other** devices
  (phone / Mac) can show this desktop's health — the "device health" pillar,
  now populated from Windows/Linux. Wires the previously-dead `helper_heartbeat`
  wrapper; **no schema change** (the RPC + columns are already live in prod —
  signature verified directly against prod, not the repo `.sql`).
  - `machine::collect_load` — a light global CPU%/mem% read (no process
    enumeration) for the heartbeat; `HelperHeartbeatRequest` gains
    `p_provider_plan_status` + `p_metrics` as `Option` with
    `skip_serializing_if=None`. `p_provider_plan_status` is `None` (the desktop
    isn't a managed on-plan host yet); when a param is `None` it's dropped so
    the server's per-field **coalesce preserves last-known** (never clobbers a
    phone's off-plan warning on a transient blip).
  - **Sensor sync into `p_metrics`** (temps + battery → the phone). Maps the
    Machine tab's sensors to the v0.63 `device_sensors` keys the RPC whitelists:
    temps by heuristic label (`cpu_temp_c`/`gpu_temp_c`/`battery_temp_c`, hottest
    match), `battery_charge_pct`, and `battery_state` mapped onto the server's
    vocabulary (`full`→`charged`, `empty`→`unknown`) — plus a `capability{}` map
    so the phone knows what this device *can* read vs. a momentary gap. Omitted
    entirely when nothing is readable (coalesce preserves). Blob is far under the
    v0.64 8192-byte guard. Pure mapping is unit-tested (label heuristics + state
    whitelist) with no hardware.
  - Best-effort + last in the tick (a heartbeat failure never fails the sync);
    rides the existing 120s cadence. `helper_sync` already marks the device
    Online — heartbeat adds cpu/mem/session-count (a benign double `now()`
    write). +7 tests (wire-shape, load range, sensor mapping).
- **Quota-bar warning-threshold ticks** (v1.30 F2a parity — CodexBar
  `MenuCardQuotaWarningMarkers`). The per-provider quota/tier bars now show
  subtle reference ticks at the warning thresholds (80% / 95% used). Because
  the bars render **remaining**, an "80% used" tick sits at `left:20%`
  (`1−f`), matching the Mac `QuotaBarMarkers.place(onRemainingBar:true)` so a
  paired account reads identically on both platforms. Ported the pure marker
  math to `src/lib/quotaMarkers.ts` (`warningFractions` + `placeOnRemainingBar`,
  5 tests); tooltip `providers.warn_threshold` × 3 langs, pinned.
  - **Deferred (gated):** the *expected-pace* marker + pace text ("12% in
    deficit · runs out in 3d") need per-tier `windowMinutes`, which the
    desktop's `TierEntry` doesn't carry yet (the Mac sets it per-collector).
    That's a follow-up under plan §5 — either add `windowMinutes` to the
    collectors (PATH A, couples to provider-window constants) or the
    server-side `window_minutes` plumbing (an ask-first shared-schema change).
- **Per-provider 30-day usage chart** (macOS `ProviderUsageHistory` parity).
  Expanding a provider card now shows a **30-day I/O-token history** mini
  bar-chart (gap-filled, brand-colored, per-day tooltip). Data from the
  already-wired `get_daily_usage(30)` server read; first frontend consumer.
  - **Wire invariant:** `ioTokens = input + output` **EXCLUDING `cached_tokens`**
    (add cache reads and the magnitudes diverge from Mac); buckets on the
    **LOCAL** `metric_date` via `lastNLocalDates` (the server buckets by the
    user's local day — using UTC here is the recurring "today invisible for
    hours" TZ trap). Honest empty state ("Not enough history yet.") when not
    signed in or no history — never a fabricated chart.
  - `localYMD` + `lastNLocalDates` helpers added to `format.ts` (+3 TZ-safe
    tests — injectable `from` date so they don't depend on the runner's
    timezone). `ProviderUsageChart` SVG component; 3 i18n keys × 3 langs,
    pinned. 87 frontend tests; no backend change.
- **Cross-device fleet health** (Machine tab — the READ half of the
  device-health pillar). Below this machine's local cockpit, a **"Your
  devices"** section now shows every device on your account with its
  last-heartbeat-reported health: Online/Offline dot, CPU% / MEM% / temp /
  battery, and "last seen X ago" (the current device marked "this device").
  This closes the loop with the heartbeat/sensor-sync slices — one device
  *writes* its health, the others *read* it. Server read (`get_devices`,
  RLS-scoped `auth.uid() = user_id`), 30s poll, paired-only; honest
  loading/empty/error states.
  - **Live round-trip verified** end-to-end against prod (no Windows device
    needed — the heartbeat is cross-platform): a rolled-back Supabase
    transaction confirmed `helper_heartbeat` writes every field this reads
    (`status→Online`, cpu/mem, `cpu_temp_c`, `battery_charge_pct`,
    `battery_state` incl. the `full→charged` map, capability, timestamps),
    with zero persistent prod change.
  - **Wire invariant:** `DeviceHealthRow` is all `#[serde(default)] Option<>`
    (+ tolerates unknown/future columns) so a Mac-evolved schema decodes
    work-or-degrade-gracefully — pinned by a partial/full/evolved decode test.
    `get_devices` mirrors the `get_sessions_history` GET. 4 fleet i18n keys +
    states × 3 langs, pinned. +1 Rust test.
- **Provider service-status badges** (v0.14 — "is it me or is the provider
  down?"). Each provider card now shows a small **status dot** driven by the
  provider's public **Atlassian Statuspage** (`status.json`) — green
  operational, amber/orange minor/major, red critical — with a localized
  tooltip + the page's own description, and a click-through to the status page.
  Covers the four shipped providers that publish a Statuspage (Claude →
  `status.claude.com`, Codex → `status.openai.com`, Cursor, Copilot →
  `githubstatus.com`); Gemini + OpenRouter have no standard Statuspage → no
  dot (honest, not an error).
  - **`src-tauri/src/service_status.rs`** — indicator model + tolerant
    `status.json` parse + catalog + a **concurrent, 5-min-cached** fetch
    (`tokio::join!`, no burst). **Public endpoints, no auth, no pairing** — so
    unlike quota collectors this is **fully CI-verifiable**: 4 parse/catalog
    unit tests (indicator mapping, catalog coverage, operational/incident
    parse, malformed-body rejection), no network needed. `get_service_statuses`
    Tauri command. 5 severity i18n keys × 3 langs, pinned.
- **DeepSeek quota collector** (v0.15 provider batch #1 — port of macOS
  `DeepSeekCollector`, itself from steipete/CodexBar MIT). Adds DeepSeek as a
  7th provider: reads the api-key (Settings → Integrations, or env
  `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`/`DEEPSEEK_KEY`), fetches `GET api.deepseek.com/user/balance`,
  and shows your balance per currency as tiers. Pure-balance (no depleting
  quota) — each positive-balance currency is a tier (`quota == remaining`);
  string-encoded balances parsed defensively; USD-positive → any-positive
  primary selection (verbatim from upstream).
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/deepseek.rs` (5 parse/mapping unit tests) + `collect_all`
    wiring + `PROVIDER_DEEPSEEK` (validated against the refreshed snapshot).
    `deepseek_api_key` added through `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file +
    migration + wipe) and a new **Settings → Integrations** input row (+2 i18n
    keys × 3). Provider literal `"DeepSeek"` matches the Mac `ProviderKind`
    rawValue so the dual-writer converges on one `(user_id, provider)` row.
  - **Verification posture:** the parse/mapping is fully unit-tested; the
    **live fetch needs a real DeepSeek key so it can't be CI-verified** (same as
    the other 6 collectors) — the endpoint/auth are ported from the proven Mac
    collector. Configure a key in Settings to exercise it live.

- **z.ai quota collector** (v0.15 provider batch #2 — port of macOS
  `ZaiCollector`). Adds z.ai (Zhipu/BigModel) as an 8th provider: reads the
  api-key (Settings → Integrations, or env `Z_AI_API_KEY`), fetches
  `GET api.z.ai/api/monitor/usage/quota/limit`, and maps each returned limit to
  a tier. Unlike DeepSeek's pure-balance, z.ai reports depleting limits: each
  `limits[]` entry (`TOKENS_LIMIT` → "Tokens", `TIME_LIMIT` → "Time") becomes a
  tier with `quota = usage + remaining` and an optional `nextResetTime`
  (epoch-ms → RFC 3339); the primary (first) limit drives the top-level gauge.
  Host is overridable via env `Z_AI_API_HOST` (BigModel CN) or the whole URL via
  `Z_AI_QUOTA_URL`.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/zai.rs` (5 parse/mapping/URL unit tests) + `collect_all`
    wiring + `PROVIDER_ZAI = "z.ai"` (validated against the Mac `ProviderKind`
    snapshot). `zai_api_key` added through `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file +
    migration + wipe) and a new **Settings → Integrations** input row (+2 i18n
    keys × 3). Provider literal `"z.ai"` matches the Mac rawValue so the
    dual-writer converges on one `(user_id, provider)` row.
  - **Verification posture:** parse/mapping/URL-resolution fully unit-tested; the
    **live fetch needs a real z.ai key so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/auth
    are ported from the proven Mac collector. Configure a key in Settings to
    exercise it live.

- **Crof quota collector** (v0.15 provider batch #3 — port of macOS `CrofCollector`,
  itself from steipete/CodexBar MIT). Adds Crof as a 9th provider: reads the api-key
  (Settings → Integrations, or env `CROF_API_KEY`), fetches `GET crof.ai/usage_api/`,
  and maps `{credits, requests_plan, usable_requests}` to tiers. Requests are the real
  **depleting quota** (`quota = requests_plan`, `remaining = clamp(usable_requests, 0,
  plan)`), resetting at the next **America/Chicago local midnight** (DST-safe). The
  uncapped credit balance — which the Mac surfaces in a `status_text` the desktop
  snapshot doesn't have — is surfaced as a second full **Credits** tier
  (`quota == remaining`), the same convention DeepSeek uses for pure balances.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/crof.rs` (6 parse/clamp/reset unit tests, `now` injectable so
    the Chicago-midnight reset is deterministic — mirrors the Mac's Gemini-C1 fix) +
    `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_CROF = "Crof"` (validated against the Mac
    `ProviderKind` snapshot). New **`chrono-tz`** dep (pure-Rust IANA tz data,
    `default-features=false`, no system libs) for the DST-safe reset. `crof_api_key`
    added through `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file + migration + wipe) and a new
    **Settings → Integrations** input row (+2 i18n keys × 3). Provider literal `"Crof"`
    matches the Mac rawValue so the dual-writer converges on one `(user_id, provider)` row.
  - **Verification posture:** parse/clamp/reset fully unit-tested (incl. CDT & CST reset
    instants); the **live fetch needs a real Crof key so it can't be CI-verified** —
    endpoint/auth ported from the proven Mac collector. Configure a key in Settings to
    exercise it live.

- **MiniMax quota collector** (v0.15 provider batch #4 — port of macOS `MiniMaxCollector`).
  Adds MiniMax as a 10th provider: reads the api-key (Settings → Integrations, or env
  `MINIMAX_API_KEY`), fetches `GET api.minimax.io/v1/coding_plan/remains`, and maps the
  flat `{model_remains, total, end_time|remains_time}` to a single **Coding Plan** tier
  (`quota = total`, `remaining = model_remains`, reset passed through verbatim — `end_time`
  wins over `remains_time`, matching the Mac). Host overridable via env `MINIMAX_HOST`, or
  the whole URL via `MINIMAX_REMAINS_URL`.
  - **API-token path only.** The Mac collector also has a cookie-auth fallback, but its own
    docs call cookie auth "less reliable (MiniMax often returns HTTP 1004 with cookies
    alone)" and the desktop credential model is api-key-based — so we carry over the
    preferred, most-stable token path. Sends the Mac's `MM-API-Source` client-attribution
    header verbatim to avoid any source-based surprise.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/minimax.rs` (5 parse/coalesce/floor/URL unit tests) + `collect_all`
    wiring + `PROVIDER_MINIMAX = "MiniMax"` (validated against the Mac `ProviderKind`
    snapshot). `minimax_api_key` added through `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file +
    migration + wipe) and a new **Settings → Integrations** input row (+2 i18n keys × 3).
    Provider literal `"MiniMax"` matches the Mac rawValue so the dual-writer converges on
    one `(user_id, provider)` row.
  - **Verification posture:** parse/mapping fully unit-tested; the **live fetch needs a real
    MiniMax key so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/auth ported from the proven Mac
    collector. Configure a key in Settings to exercise it live.

- **Moonshot (Kimi platform) balance collector** (v0.15 provider batch #5 — port of macOS
  `MoonshotCollector`). Adds Moonshot as an 11th provider: reads the api-key (Settings →
  Integrations, or env `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`), fetches `GET {base}/v1/users/me/balance`, and
  maps the developer-platform USD balance to tiers. This is the **developer-platform**
  balance (api-key), distinct from the consumer Kimi chat app. Pure uncapped balance (like
  DeepSeek): the available balance drives a full-bar gauge; positive voucher/cash components
  are informational full tiers (negative cash/deficit skipped). Base overridable via env
  `MOONSHOT_API_BASE` (default `api.moonshot.ai`; China: `api.moonshot.cn`). Honors the
  Chinese-API success gate (`code == 0 && status == true`).
  - **Unit scale — `× 100_000`, not cents.** The Mac Moonshot collector encodes USD as
    `round(usd × 100_000)` on the shared `(user_id, "Moonshot")` row; the desktop mirrors that
    exact scale so a dual-writer (Mac + desktop, same key) converges instead of flip-flopping
    the balance 1000× per sync. (Each desktop collector matches its own Mac twin's scale —
    DeepSeek↔cents, Moonshot↔units.)
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/moonshot.rs` (6 gate/scale/tier unit tests) + `collect_all` wiring +
    `PROVIDER_MOONSHOT = "Moonshot"` (validated against the Mac `ProviderKind` snapshot).
    `moonshot_api_key` added through `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file + migration + wipe)
    and a new **Settings → Integrations** input row (+2 i18n keys × 3). Provider literal
    `"Moonshot"` matches the Mac rawValue so the dual-writer converges on one row.
  - **Verification posture:** parse/gate/scale fully unit-tested; the **live fetch needs a
    real Moonshot key so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/auth ported from the proven Mac
    collector. Configure a key in Settings to exercise it live.

- **Venice balance collector** (v0.15 provider batch #6 — port of macOS `VeniceCollector`,
  itself from steipete/CodexBar MIT). Adds Venice as a 12th provider: reads the api-key
  (Settings → Integrations, or env `VENICE_API_KEY` / `VENICE_KEY`), fetches
  `GET api.venice.ai/api/v1/billing/balance`, and maps the dual-currency USD + DIEM balance
  to tiers (cents). The DIEM balance becomes a **cap-aware** tier when `diemEpochAllocation > 0`
  (`quota = cap`, `remaining = min(cap, diem)` — a real depleting quota); otherwise a no-cap
  full tier. USD is a no-cap full tier. The top-level gauge mirrors the most-informative
  primary (cap-aware DIEM > positive USD > positive DIEM). Values arrive as JSON numbers OR
  numeric strings — a flexible decoder coerces both (vendored from upstream).
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/venice.rs` (5 tiering/cap/flexible-decode unit tests) + `collect_all`
    wiring + `PROVIDER_VENICE = "Venice"` (validated against the Mac `ProviderKind` snapshot).
    `venice_api_key` added through `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file + migration + wipe) and
    a new **Settings → Integrations** input row (+2 i18n keys × 3). Provider literal `"Venice"`
    matches the Mac rawValue so the dual-writer converges on one row. Uses **cents (×100)** to
    match the Mac Venice collector's scale (each desktop balance collector mirrors its own twin).
  - **Verification posture:** parse/tiering/flexible-decode fully unit-tested; the **live fetch
    needs a real Venice key so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/auth ported from the proven
    Mac collector. Configure a key in Settings to exercise it live.

- **Kimi K2 credit collector** (v0.15 provider batch #7 — port of macOS `KimiK2Collector`).
  Adds Kimi K2 as a 13th provider: reads the api-key (Settings → Integrations, or env
  `KIMI_K2_API_KEY` / `KIMI_API_KEY` / `KIMI_KEY`), fetches `GET kimi-k2.ai/api/user/credits`,
  and maps the consumed + remaining split to a **Credits** tier. Unlike the pure-balance
  collectors this is a real depleting gauge (`quota = consumed + remaining`, `remaining =
  remaining`). The response shape varies — fields may be flat, nested under `data`, or
  `data.usage`, under any of several candidate key names — so a flexible search extracts them
  (vendored from upstream). Uses **units (×100_000)** to match the Mac Kimi K2 scale.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/kimik2.rs` (6 flexible-parse / nesting / scale unit tests) +
    `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_KIMI_K2 = "Kimi K2"`. `kimi_k2_api_key` added through
    `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file + migration + wipe) and a new **Settings →
    Integrations** input row (+2 i18n keys × 3).
  - **Verification posture:** parse/nesting/scale fully unit-tested; the **live fetch needs a
    real Kimi K2 key so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/auth ported from the proven Mac
    collector. Configure a key in Settings to exercise it live.

### Internal

- **`MAC_PROVIDER_KIND_SNAPSHOT` completed to the full 49-entry Mac `ProviderKind` set** — the
  earlier "47-provider" refresh had silently missed **`kimiK2` ("Kimi K2")** and **`t3chat`
  ("T3 Chat")**. Both added so the provider-literal contract test guards every real Mac case.
  (Caught while porting Kimi K2, whose literal wasn't in the fixture.)

- **Augment credit collector** (v0.16 cookie batch #1 — port of macOS `AugmentCollector`). Adds
  Augment as a 14th provider — and the **first cookie-session collector** beyond the built-in
  Cursor. Reads a session cookie (Settings → Integrations paste, or env `AUGMENT_COOKIE`), fetches
  `GET app.augmentcode.com/api/credits` (+ best-effort `/api/subscription` for plan name + billing
  reset), and maps the `usageUnitsRemaining` / `usageUnitsConsumedThisBillingCycle` split to a real
  depleting **Credits** tier (`quota = remaining + consumed`, raw unit counts). Unlike the Mac's
  automatic browser-cookie import, the desktop uses a **manual paste** (same as Cursor) — cookies
  expire, so the card shows a red badge once the session lapses; re-paste to refresh.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/augment.rs` (5 parse/tiering unit tests) + `collect_all` wiring +
    `PROVIDER_AUGMENT = "Augment"` (validated against the Mac `ProviderKind` snapshot). New
    `augment_cookie` cred through `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file + migration + wipe) and a
    **Settings → Integrations** cookie-paste row (+2 i18n keys × 3, cookie-worded).
  - **Verification posture:** parse/tiering fully unit-tested; the **live fetch needs a real Augment
    session cookie so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoints/auth ported from the proven Mac collector.
    Paste a cookie in Settings to exercise it live.

- **Perplexity credit collector** (v0.16 cookie batch #2 — port of macOS `PerplexityCollector`, itself
  from steipete/CodexBar MIT). Adds Perplexity as a 15th provider (2nd cookie collector). Reads a session
  cookie (Settings paste, or env `PERPLEXITY_SESSION_TOKEN` / `PERPLEXITY_COOKIE`), fetches
  `GET perplexity.ai/rest/billing/credits` (with browser-like Origin/Referer/User-Agent headers — the
  endpoint 403s without them), and attributes credit grants with a **waterfall** (recurring → purchased →
  promotional): `total_usage_cents` drains each pool in order, so each tier shows `remaining = pool_total
  − pool_used`. Expired promotional grants are excluded; the plan (Free/Pro/Max) is inferred from the
  recurring pool. Scaled at **$1 = 100 000 units** (the OpenRouter convention the Mac uses here).
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/perplexity.rs` (6 waterfall / expiry / plan / scale unit tests, with an injectable
    clock so promo-expiry is deterministic) + `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_PERPLEXITY = "Perplexity"`.
    New `perplexity_cookie` cred through `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file + migration + wipe) and a
    **Settings → Integrations** cookie-paste row (+2 i18n keys × 3).
  - **Verification posture:** attribution / scale / plan fully unit-tested; the **live fetch needs a real
    Perplexity session cookie so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/auth ported from the proven Mac
    collector. Paste a cookie in Settings to exercise it live.

- **T3 Chat usage collector** (v0.16 cookie batch #3 — port of macOS `T3ChatCollector`, itself from
  steipete/CodexBar MIT). Adds T3 Chat as a 16th provider (3rd cookie collector) — and the **first
  cookie collector with a real percent-window quota gauge** (like Claude/Codex, not a balance). Reads a
  session cookie (Settings paste, or env `T3CHAT_COOKIE`), fetches
  `GET t3.chat/api/trpc/getCustomerData` (tRPC → JSONL, with browser-like + tRPC headers), recursively
  locates the customer object in the JSONL envelope, and maps two *used*-percentage windows (4-hour +
  monthly) to `remaining = 100 − used` gauges (`quota = 100`). The 4-hour window is the headline; plan
  name is title-cased from the subscription. A 429 Vercel bot-challenge surfaces an actionable
  "refresh your cookie" error.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/t3chat.rs` (6 JSONL-finder / percent-clamp / plan / ms-epoch unit tests) +
    `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_T3CHAT = "T3 Chat"`. New `t3chat_cookie` cred through
    `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file + migration + wipe) and a **Settings → Integrations**
    cookie-paste row (+2 i18n keys × 3). Note: the Mac's per-tier `windowMinutes` isn't carried (the
    desktop `TierEntry` has no such field yet — same reason pace text is still deferred).
  - **Verification posture:** JSONL parsing / percent mapping / plan inference fully unit-tested; the
    **live fetch needs a real T3 Chat session cookie so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/auth ported
    from the proven Mac collector. Paste a cookie in Settings to exercise it live.

- **StepFun (阶跃星辰) usage collector** (v0.16 cookie batch #4 — port of macOS `StepFunCollector`, itself
  from steipete/CodexBar MIT). Adds StepFun as a 17th provider (4th cookie collector). Reads the
  `Oasis-Token` cookie (Settings paste, or env `STEPFUN_COOKIE` / `STEPFUN_OASIS_TOKEN`), `POST`s the
  plain-JSON connect-RPC `QueryStepPlanRateLimit` (+ a grace-bounded best-effort `GetStepPlanStatus` for
  the plan name), and maps two *left-rate* windows (5-hour + weekly, each 0…1) to `remaining =
  round(rate·100)` percent gauges (`quota = 100`, like Claude/Codex). The 5-hour window is the headline.
  **Security:** upstream can password-login; we never do — the standalone `Oasis-Token` cookie drives the
  RPCs directly (`Oasis-Webid` read from the cookie or a vendored fallback). Flexible int|float rate and
  string|int timestamp decoders tolerate the API's shape drift.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/stepfun.rs` (7 cookie-extract / flexible-decode / gate / percent-clamp unit
    tests) + `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_STEPFUN = "StepFun"`. New `stepfun_cookie` cred through
    `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file + migration + wipe) and a **Settings → Integrations**
    cookie-paste row (+2 i18n keys × 3).
  - **Verification posture:** cookie extraction / RPC parsing / percent mapping fully unit-tested; the
    **live fetch needs a real StepFun `Oasis-Token` cookie so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoints/auth
    ported from the proven Mac collector. Paste a cookie in Settings to exercise it live.

- **Warp usage collector** (v0.16 — GraphQL, port of macOS `WarpCollector`). Adds Warp as an 18th
  provider. Despite the GraphQL transport it's an ordinary **Bearer api-key** collector (env
  `WARP_API_KEY` / `WARP_TOKEN`, or Settings): it `POST`s a fixed query + empty `requestContext` to
  `app.warp.dev/graphql/v2` and parses the nested `data.user.user.{requestLimitInfo,bonusGrants}` JSON. A
  real depleting `.quota` (raw request counts): the request allocation
  (`requestLimit` / `requestsUsedSinceLastRefresh`) is the headline **Requests** tier; bonus grants
  aggregate into a **Bonus Credits** tier. Unlimited plans have no numeric gauge (surfaced via
  `plan_type: "Unlimited"`).
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/warp.rs` (5 free/unlimited/bonus-aggregate/over-limit unit tests) + `collect_all`
    wiring + `PROVIDER_WARP = "Warp"`. New `warp_api_key` cred through `provider_creds` (OS-keychain +
    file + migration + wipe) and a **Settings → Integrations** input row (+2 i18n keys × 3).
  - **Verification posture:** GraphQL response parsing / tiering fully unit-tested; the **live fetch needs
    a real Warp token so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/query/auth ported from the proven Mac
    collector. Configure a token in Settings to exercise it live.

- **Kimi (consumer app) usage collector** (v0.16 — Connect-RPC, port of macOS `KimiCollector`). Adds
  Kimi as a 19th provider — **distinct from the existing Kimi K2** (that's the kimi-k2.ai developer
  api-key balance; this is the kimi.com coding-console usage). Despite the `…BillingService/GetUsages`
  Connect-RPC endpoint it uses the **JSON codec** (`Content-Type: application/json`,
  `connect-protocol-version: 1`, body `{"scope":["FEATURE_CODING"]}`) — an ordinary HTTP+JSON POST, not
  protobuf. Auth: the `kimi-auth` JWT (env `KIMI_AUTH_TOKEN` or Settings) — the value may be the raw JWT
  or a full Cookie header, from which the `kimi-auth=…` value is extracted. Maps a weekly window
  (headline) + an optional 5-hour rate-limit window; all counts arrive as JSON strings.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/kimi.rs` (6 window-mapping / string-parse / token-extract unit tests) +
    `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_KIMI = "Kimi"`. New `kimi_auth_token` cred through `provider_creds`
    (OS-keychain + file + migration + wipe) and a **Settings → Integrations** token-paste row (+2 i18n
    keys × 3).
  - **Verification posture:** Connect-JSON response parsing / windowing fully unit-tested; the **live
    fetch needs a real `kimi-auth` token so it can't be CI-verified** — endpoint/auth ported from the
    proven Mac collector. Paste a token in Settings to exercise it live.

- **Grok usage collector** (v0.16 — gRPC-web, port of macOS `GrokCollector`). Adds Grok as a 20th
  provider — and the first **gRPC-web + protobuf** collector. `POST`s an empty gRPC-web frame to
  `grok.com/…/GetGrokCreditsConfig` with a session cookie (Settings paste / env `GROK_COOKIE`) or a
  Bearer token (env `GROK_TOKEN`), then heuristically scans the **schema-less protobuf** response: the
  used-percent is the `fixed32`/Float whose field path ends in `1` (0…100, shallowest then earliest);
  the reset is a future unix-timestamp varint (seconds or millis), preferring path `[1,5,1]`. Maps to a
  Credits `%`-gauge (`.quota`); degrades to a 0/0 "connected" snapshot if no percent is found. gRPC-web
  framing, the recursive protobuf wire scanner, and the field-path heuristics are ported **verbatim**
  from the proven Mac collector, and grpc-status is validated from both HTTP headers and trailer frames.
  - `src-tauri/src/quota/grok.rs` (9 unit tests over synthetic gRPC-web/protobuf frames: percent extract,
    reset at `[1,5,1]`, millis division, no-usage-yet, combined→tier, status-only degrade, frame
    splitting, grpc-status rejection, empty-payload) + `collect_all` wiring + `PROVIDER_GROK = "Grok"`.
    New `grok_cookie` cred through `provider_creds` (OS-keychain + file + migration + wipe) and a
    **Settings → Integrations** cookie-paste row (+2 i18n keys × 3).
  - **Verification posture:** the byte-level scanner + framing are exhaustively unit-tested against
    synthetic frames, but the **schema-less field-path heuristics were reverse-engineered against real
    Grok responses that CI can't reach** — a live grok.com cookie is the only true end-to-end check
    (same caveat as every collector, amplified by the schema-less parse). Paste a cookie in Settings to
    exercise it live.

### Provider coverage note

With Grok, **every Mac `ProviderKind` case that maps to the desktop's tier-based `QuotaSnapshot` is now
ported** — 14 net-new collectors this cycle (DeepSeek, z.ai, Crof, MiniMax, Moonshot, Venice, Kimi K2,
Augment, Perplexity, T3 Chat, StepFun, Warp, Kimi, Grok) across api-key REST, cookie-session, JSON
connect-RPC, GraphQL, and gRPC-web transports. The only remaining Mac collectors are the
**`statusOnly`** ones (GLM, Volcano Engine, Groq, Mistral, Deepgram) — deferred until the desktop
`QuotaSnapshot` gains a `status_text` concept, since they carry no numeric gauge to render.

- **Provider-contract snapshot refreshed to the full Mac `ProviderKind` set**
  (47 providers; Codex P2). The `MAC_PROVIDER_KIND_SNAPSHOT` test fixture was a
  stale 6-entry list; it now mirrors the whole Mac provider enum (status/session
  cases excluded) so each *future* quota collector's provider literal is
  validated against the real contract — a hard guard against a dual-writer
  forking the `(user_id, provider)` PK on a casing/spacing typo (`z.ai`,
  `Vertex AI`, `Abacus AI`, `AWS Bedrock`…). +1 uniqueness/coverage test. This
  is the prep step before the provider-expansion batch (v0.15+).

### Fixed

- **Claude family-fallback pricing** (`pricing.rs`) — a Claude model id
  not in the pricing table (e.g. a freshly-released minor like
  `claude-opus-4-8`) priced to **$0**, silently collapsing Today/Week cost
  and every cost chart the day the model ships. `normalize_claude_model`
  now resolves an unknown `claude-(opus|sonnet|haiku)-N-M` to the
  highest-numbered priced sibling in the same family (e.g.
  `claude-opus-4-8` → `claude-opus-4-7`), mirroring Swift
  `CostUsageScanner.Pricing.familyFallback` byte-for-byte (both tables
  carry identical family keys). Exact matches still take precedence; a
  `minor < 100` cap stops a legacy dated row (`claude-opus-4-20250514`)
  from masquerading as a high minor; a brand-new *generation* with no
  priced sibling still returns `None` (unchanged, matches Mac). +6 unit
  tests. This is the exact class of bug that hid the missing
  `claude-opus-4-7` entry back in v0.2.11.

### CI / Infra

- **Automated GUI launch-smoke** (`smoke-launch-windows` hard gate +
  `smoke-launch-linux` advisory, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Builds a
  **release** binary (`--no-bundle`) and launches it headlessly in smoke
  mode, asserting **process-alive** (catches crash-on-launch, v0.8.0 BEX64)
  and a **`frontend-ready` marker** (the React tree actually mounted inside
  WebView2/WebKitGTK — catches white-screen, v0.2.11), plus a soft
  window/screenshot check. The enabling task for developing without a
  Windows machine: the crash/white-screen incident classes are now caught in
  CI instead of on a VM. (Wrong-binary class stays covered by `release.yml`'s
  bundle check.) Windows blocks; Linux is advisory until WebKitGTK-under-xvfb
  render is proven.
  - **`smoke_mark_frontend_ready` command + `src-tauri/src/smoke.rs`** —
    env-gated marker write (`CLI_PULSE_SMOKE_MARKER`); a pure no-op in
    production (no file, one cheap IPC on mount). React calls it from a
    one-shot on-mount effect. 4 unit tests (env gating + write + overwrite,
    no global-env / host-TZ dependency).
  - **`scripts/ci-smoke-launch.{ps1,sh}`** — the launch-smoke drivers
    (`EnumWindows`/`xdotool` + `CopyFromScreen`/`import` screenshot),
    also runnable locally / on the VM.
  - **Tab-traversal render pass** (`smoke_is_active` command + smoke-mode
    effect). In smoke mode the frontend renders **every tab** once before
    writing the marker — if any tab throws during render, the ErrorBoundary
    unmounts `<App/>` and the marker never appears → CI fails. This extends
    the mount-only gate to catch the v0.2.11 tab-crash class for **every**
    tab (not just the default one), so a broken tab — the Machine tab above,
    or any future UI slice — can't reach Latest. Zero production cost
    (`smoke_is_active` returns false → no cycle). +1 unit test.
- **ci.yml ARM matrix** left as-is — investigated as a possible cost leak
  and it is **not** one: this repo is public, and standard `windows-11-arm` /
  `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runners are free on public repos since GA 2025-08-07
  (the old "$11/mo" was the release matrix, removed 2026-05-04).

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-09

**Stability sprint #5 — keyboard shortcuts.** Power users have asked
for this; the v0.6.1 Esc-modal fix already showed the foundation
works in Tauri 2 / WebView2.

### Added

- **Global keyboard shortcuts** (App.tsx keydown handler):
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + R` — rescan local logs (overrides browser refresh)
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + ,` — open Settings tab
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + 1..5` — switch tabs (Overview / Providers / Sessions
    / Alerts / Settings); skipped when typing in input/textarea/select
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + /` — toggle the shortcut help overlay
  - `Esc` — close modals (per-modal handlers, unchanged from v0.6.1)
- **`ShortcutHelpOverlay`** component — modal listing all shortcuts
  with platform-aware modifier key (`⌘` on macOS, `Ctrl` elsewhere).
  Click outside or press Esc to close.
- **11 i18n keys × 3 langs** for the help overlay labels + an
  `action.close` key (used by the overlay's close button). All
  pinned in `i18n.test.ts` critical-labels.

### Out of scope (deferred)

- **Date range picker** — touches the data-fetching layer (Overview /
  Providers / Sessions all need to thread the range param through).
  Punted to a later v0.10.x ship to keep v0.10.0's blast radius
  contained.
- **Per-provider visibility toggle** — small but touches the
  Providers tab rendering. Folded into the v0.10.x ship.

### Tests
285 backend (unchanged — no Rust changes). 57 frontend (unchanged;
the 11 new i18n keys are exercised via the critical-labels gate).

### Sprint context
Fifth ship of the v0.9.x → v0.10.x sprint:
- v0.9.0 ✅ Stability hardening
- v0.9.1 ✅ Agent scaffolding (stub)
- v0.9.2 ✅ ConPTY transport + FFI
- v0.9.3 ✅ Diagnostic bundle
- v0.10.0 ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (THIS ship)
- v0.10.1 — Date range + per-provider visibility + export + compare
  (next; possibly split further depending on review)

## [0.9.3] — 2026-05-09

**Stability sprint #4 — diagnostic bundle.** Adds a one-click
"Save diagnostic bundle" button to Settings → About that zips the
files a maintainer would need to triage a bug report. Closes the
v0.8.0-incident-style "verifier manually collects 5 files for 20
min" loop.

### Added
- **`src-tauri/src/diagnostic_bundle.rs`** new module — creates a
  zip in `~/Downloads/cli-pulse-diag-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.zip`
  containing:
  - `cli-pulse.log` (main app log, full file)
  - `remote-hook.log` (hook subprocess log)
  - `crash-history.jsonl` (v0.9.0 recovery markers, if any)
  - `diagnostic_snapshot.json` (the existing platform snapshot)
  - `versions.txt` (sanity check)
  Best-effort: missing files are skipped, not errors. Bundle creation
  succeeds even with no logs (returns just the in-memory entries).
- **`save_diagnostic_bundle` Tauri command** + frontend
  `SaveDiagnosticBundleButton` in Settings → About. Three states:
  idle / saving / done (shows zip path for ~6s, then idle).
- **5 i18n keys × 3 langs** (en / zh-CN / ja). Tooltip explains
  the privacy posture: "Bundle is saved locally — review the
  contents before sharing. Does NOT contain credentials, but log
  lines may include cwd basenames."
- **Explicit `zip = "4"` dep declaration** in `Cargo.toml` (was
  already a transitive dep via `tauri-plugin-updater`; pinning
  explicitly is zero binary cost).

### Privacy posture
- Bundle saved LOCALLY to `~/Downloads/`, never auto-uploaded
- `helper_secret`, `refresh_token`, OAuth tokens, JWTs are NEVER
  written into the bundle
- Full PDB symbols (~27 MB) are NOT included; they're already on
  the GitHub release page
- WER mdmp files are NOT included; those contain process memory
  that may have OAuth tokens — maintainer asks separately on a
  case-by-case basis with explicit user consent

### Tests
281 → 285 backend (+4 in `diagnostic_bundle::tests`):
- timestamp filename-safety (no `:` / `/` / `\\`)
- Unix epoch handling
- bundle creation with only extras (no disk files)
- bundle creation with nonexistent files in SOURCES list
- days_to_ymd known dates

Frontend 57 unchanged (the 5 new i18n keys are exercised via the
critical-labels gate).

### Sprint context
Fourth ship of the v0.9.x → v0.10.x sprint:
- v0.9.0 ✅ Stability hardening
- v0.9.1 ✅ Agent scaffolding (stub)
- v0.9.2 ✅ ConPTY transport + FFI
- v0.9.3 ✅ Diagnostic bundle (THIS ship)
- v0.10.0 — UX polish (next)
- v0.10.1 — Export + compare

## [0.9.2] — 2026-05-09

**Stability sprint #3 — ConPTY managed-session host RETURNS (FFI ship).**

v0.9.1 brought back the agent scaffolding (with the v0.8.0 root cause
fixed: `tokio::spawn` → `tauri::async_runtime::spawn` in setup hook)
but used a `StubTransport` that returned errors from every method.
v0.9.2 swaps the stub for `ConPtyTransport` — same content as the
v0.8.0 transport.rs (which had no bugs in the FFI itself; the v0.8.0
incident was the agent spawn site, NOT transport.rs).

This re-attempts the v0.8.0 ship with all 7 lessons applied:
1. Spawn site uses `tauri::async_runtime::spawn` (the v0.8.0 fix)
2. Pre-push hook fails on bare `tokio::spawn` outside test contexts
3. Sentry sync-flush in panic hook (v0.9.0) so any future panic
   reaches Sentry reliably
4. Crash-recovery mode (v0.9.0) breaks the launch-crash loop after
   3 crashes within 5 min
5. `CLI_PULSE_DISABLE_REMOTE_AGENT=1` env kill-switch (v0.9.1)
6. PDB upload artifact (v0.8.2) for symbolizing future fault offsets
7. Mandatory VM smoke gate before promote-to-Latest (sprint rule)

### Added
- **`src-tauri/src/remote/transport.rs`** restored from v0.8.0 commit
  `c37cec0` verbatim. All 4 plan-review fixes baked in:
  - **P0 #1**: `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` wrapping every sync
    transport call in agent.rs
  - **P0 #2**: 0x03-byte cross-platform Ctrl-C (avoids host-kill
    risk; the canonical Windows Terminal / wezterm / alacritty
    pattern; works because ConPTY isolates the child's console)
  - **P1**: Job Object `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` for orphan auto-cleanup
    on Windows (kernel-level guarantee, no heuristics)
  - **P2**: `Drop` on `HandleInner` (Arc-wrapped) so teardown
    runs when the LAST clone goes out of scope
- All 3 v0.8.0 post-impl review P1 fixes baked in:
  - per-call `tokio::time::timeout(5s)` in dispatch
  - log rotation Win write-bit (`OpenOptions::write(true).append(true)`)
  - graceful shutdown via `manager.shutdown()` before loop exits
- **`portable-pty 0.9`** + **`windows-sys 0.59`** deps re-added
  (with `Win32_Security` feature for `CreateJobObjectW` — the v0.8.2
  fix). Cfg-gated to Windows targets only.
- **Frontend spawn dialog** restored — `SpawnSessionLauncher`
  component on the Sessions tab. Click "+ Start new session" →
  modal with cwd field, optional label, static "Claude" provider
  → submit calls `request_remote_session_start` Tauri command →
  `remote_app_request_session_start` server-side → agent loop
  picks up the start command on next 1s tick and spawns via
  `ConPtyTransport`.
- **`AgentDiagnosticBlock`** in Settings → About — three lines
  (running count / lifetime hosted / last-tick age). Polls every
  5 s while About is mounted. "Not running" line when
  `agent_diagnostic` returns null (not paired / recovery mode /
  env kill-switch).
- **13 i18n keys × 3 langs** (en / zh-CN / ja) for the spawn
  dialog + agent diagnostic. All pinned in `i18n.test.ts`'s
  critical-labels list.

### Changed
- `lib.rs::run`'s setup hook now constructs `ConPtyTransport`
  instead of `StubTransport`. The 3-way gate from v0.9.1 stays
  (paired AND `!recovery_mode` AND `!env_killed`).

### Tests
283 → 281 backend tests (-2 net). The v0.8.0 transport.rs has
fewer transport-specific tests than the v0.9.1 stub had (the stub
had +7 stub-contract tests; the real transport has the agent-
integration tests +5 covering ConPTY-specific behavior). Frontend
57 unchanged.

### Reviewer fixes — Gemini 3.1 Pro
- Plan v1 review: 2 P0 + 3 P1 + 3 P2 + 2 P3, all addressed in v2
- Plan v2 review: API capacity exhausted at review time. Self-
  verified via 1:1 mapping of v1 findings; Codex review path
  required SendMessage tool which wasn't available
- v0.9.2 diff review: API capacity still exhausted. Will retry
  pre-VM-smoke; if still exhausted, ship and review post-impl.

### Sprint context
Third ship of the v0.9.x → v0.10.x post-incident sprint:
- v0.9.0 ✅ Stability hardening
- v0.9.1 ✅ Agent scaffolding (stub transport)
- v0.9.2 ✅ ConPTY transport + FFI (THIS ship — the v0.8.0 redo)
- v0.9.3 — diagnostic bundle + binary polish (next)
- v0.10.0 — UX polish
- v0.10.1 — Export + compare

**Mandatory VM smoke gate before promote-to-Latest.** This is the
ship that re-introduces the FFI surface that crashed v0.8.0. Latest
stays at v0.7.0 until the verifier reports PASS on
`scripts/vm-smoke-full.ps1` against v0.9.2.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-05-08

**Stability sprint #2 — ConPTY managed-session host SCAFFOLDING (no
FFI yet).** v0.8.0 shipped a full ConPTY implementation that crashed
on launch (BEX64). Sentry confirmed the root cause:
`tokio::spawn(...)` from inside Tauri's `setup` hook, which runs
OUTSIDE any tokio runtime context — panic with "no reactor running",
amplified by `panic = "abort"` into immediate process termination.

v0.8.1 reverted the entire feature. v0.9.1 brings back the agent
**scaffolding** with the bug fixed (`tauri::async_runtime::spawn`
instead of `tokio::spawn`) but uses a **stub transport** that returns
`TransportError::Internal` from every method. v0.9.2 adds the actual
ConPTY + Job Object FFI on top, swapping the stub for `ConPtyTransport`.

This 2-phase split (Gemini 3.1 Pro plan-review P3) keeps the blast
radius small: v0.9.1 validates the agent's tick loop / RPC dispatch
/ event posting on its own; v0.9.2 adds FFI risk to a smaller diff.

### Added

- **`src-tauri/src/remote/{transport, agent, events}.rs`** — restored
  from v0.8.0 commit `c37cec0` with three changes:
  1. **`tokio::spawn` → `tauri::async_runtime::spawn`** in
     `agent::spawn_agent_loop` (THE v0.8.0 fix; one-line bug)
  2. `transport.rs` is now `StubTransport` instead of `ConPtyTransport`
     — every method returns `TransportError::Internal("v0.9.1a stub
     transport — ConPTY spawn not yet implemented in this build
     (planned for v0.9.1b)")`. No portable-pty, no windows-sys, no
     Job Object, no reader thread.
  3. `JoinHandle` import switched from `tokio::task::JoinHandle` to
     `tauri::async_runtime::JoinHandle` (Tauri 2 has its own
     JoinHandle type; importing tokio's gave a type mismatch on the
     `AgentHandle.join` field — caught by the compiler the moment the
     spawn-API change went in).

- **4 helper RPC wrappers** restored in `supabase.rs`:
  `remote_helper_register_session`, `remote_helper_pull_commands`,
  `remote_helper_post_event`, `remote_helper_complete_command`. All
  4 target already-live RPCs the Mac team shipped in `cli-pulse`
  Phase 2 iter1 (2026-05-03); no new server-side schema changes.

- **`remote_request_session_start` wrapper** in `supabase.rs` — the
  app-side RPC for the spawn dialog UI to call.

- **2 Tauri commands**: `request_remote_session_start` (frontend
  spawn dialog will call this in v0.9.2; for v0.9.1 it's exposed via
  the invoke handler but no UI dialog ships yet) and
  `agent_diagnostic` (returns running count / lifetime count /
  last-tick age — `null` when agent isn't running).

- **`CLI_PULSE_DISABLE_REMOTE_AGENT=1` kill-switch env var.** Set to
  any value to skip the agent loop spawn. Logged at startup so users
  can verify their env flag took effect. Combined with the v0.9.0
  recovery-mode flag, the agent has a 3-way gate: paired AND not in
  recovery mode AND not env-killed.

- **Pre-push hook regression guard for `tokio::spawn`** in
  `scripts/git-hooks/pre-push`. Greps `src-tauri/src/**.rs` for
  `tokio::spawn(`, filters out hits whose surrounding 50 lines
  contain `#[tokio::test]` / `mod tests {` / `#[cfg(test)]`. Any
  remaining hit fails the pre-push with a message pointing at the
  v0.8.0 root cause. Legitimate non-test calls (e.g. `quota::collect_all`
  inside an async fn called from a Tauri command) opt out via
  `// @allow tokio-spawn` annotation. Six such annotations added in
  `quota/mod.rs` with rationale (those calls are inside async fns
  that always run inside Tauri's tokio runtime).

- **Shutdown sleep** in `lib.rs::run`'s post-`tauri::Builder::run`
  exit path. Sleeps 2 s after `stop.store(true)` to give the agent
  loop time to drain its final tick + post `kind=info` `app_shutdown`
  for any running sessions before `record_clean_exit`. Bounded by
  the agent's per-call 5 s timeouts.

### Changed

- `lib.rs::run`'s setup hook now spawns `RemoteAgentManager` with
  `StubTransport` when:
  1. Device is paired (need helper_secret for RPC auth)
  2. NOT in recovery mode (v0.9.0 crash-loop circuit breaker)
  3. `CLI_PULSE_DISABLE_REMOTE_AGENT` env var unset

  Otherwise logs the reason for skipping. The agent ticks every 1 s,
  pulls commands from `remote_helper_pull_commands`, and dispatches.
  For `start` commands: `StubTransport.start()` returns
  `TransportError::Internal` → agent posts `kind=errored` lifecycle
  event + `kind=info` detail event with the stub's reason → calls
  `remote_helper_complete_command(failed)` so the queue advances. UI
  surfaces the row's flip from `pending` → `errored`.

### v0.9.1a behavior end-to-end

When (in some future v0.9.2+ build) a user clicks "+ Start new
session":
1. Frontend invokes `request_remote_session_start` Tauri command
2. Backend calls `supabase::remote_request_session_start` →
   server creates `remote_sessions(status='pending')` + queues
   `kind='start'` command
3. Agent loop pulls the command on its next 1 s tick
4. `StubTransport::start()` returns
   `Internal("v0.9.1a stub transport — ConPTY spawn not yet
   implemented in this build (planned for v0.9.1b)")`
5. Agent posts `kind=errored` status + `kind=info` detail with
   the stub's reason; calls `complete_command(failed, error=reason)`
6. UI surfaces the error message

For v0.9.1, no UI dialog ships — the Tauri command is exposed but
not wired into the Sessions tab. Users / Mac side can exercise the
agent path by sending a start command directly via the existing
Sessions wire-up.

### Tests

263 → 283 backend tests (+20):
- 7 in `remote::transport::tests` (StubTransport contract,
  Default, with_reason, dyn object safety, try_wait returns
  Some-not-None defensively, all-methods-return-Internal)
- 13 in `remote::agent::tests` (preserved from v0.8.0; the bug
  was outside the test surface)
- 0 in `remote::events::tests` already counted in v0.8.0

### Sprint context

Second ship of the v0.9.x → v0.10.x post-incident sprint. Sequence:
- v0.9.0 ✅ Stability hardening (Sentry sync-flush, crash recovery,
  categorized update errors)
- v0.9.1 ✅ ConPTY agent scaffolding (THIS ship)
- v0.9.2 — ConPTY transport + FFI (the "big one" that re-attempts
  the v0.8.0 work with the lessons applied)
- v0.9.3 — diagnostic bundle + binary polish
- v0.10.0 — keyboard shortcuts + date range + per-provider visibility
- v0.10.1 — CSV/JSON export + provider compare

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-08

**Stability sprint #1 — driven by lessons from the v0.8.0 BEX64
incident.** Three orthogonal hardening fixes bundled because none
is large enough to warrant its own ship and all three reduce the
recurrence risk for the v0.9.1 ConPTY redo coming next.

### Added
- **Sentry sync-flush panic hook** (`src-tauri/src/sentry_init.rs`).
  Under `panic = "abort"` in our release profile, sentry-rust's
  auto-installed panic hook captures into an MPSC channel that the
  worker thread reads + sends — but `abort()` runs immediately
  after the hook chain returns, racing with the worker thread to
  drain the channel before process exit. v0.8.0 events DID arrive
  in Sentry but only by luck. Fix: install our own panic hook that
  wraps sentry's, captures the event via the chained hook, then
  blocks on `Client::close(Some(2s))` to flush synchronously
  before chaining to default abort. Gemini 3.1 Pro plan-review P1.
- **Crash-recovery mode** (`src-tauri/src/crash_recovery.rs`, new
  module). Append-only JSONL at `<config_dir>/crash-history.jsonl`
  records `{ts, phase, version}` markers. `record_startup()` runs
  at the very top of `lib.rs::run`; `record_setup_complete()` runs
  at end of Tauri's setup hook closure; `record_clean_exit()` runs
  after `Builder::run` returns. `assess_recovery_mode_at_startup()`
  walks the JSONL and counts crashes (a `Starting` whose nearest
  following entry is another `Starting`, within a 5-min window).
  ≥3 crashes flips an atomic `RECOVERY_MODE` flag.
  - Recovery mode active: tray refresh loop SKIPPED (tray icon
    itself still installs so users can Quit cleanly), agent loop
    will be skipped when v0.9.1+ ships
  - **Sentry stays ON** in recovery mode (Gemini P2: telemetry
    during a crash loop is the right direction, not the wrong one)
  - Privacy: crash-history is local-only, just timestamp + phase
    + version. File capped at 100 entries with FIFO rotation. The
    diagnostic-bundle button planned for v0.9.2 will ship this
    file with explicit user consent.
- **Categorized update error messages** in the Settings → Updates
  banner. Frontend `categorizeUpdateError(raw)` maps common
  tauri-plugin-updater failure shapes onto 6 actionable i18n keys:
  - `updater.error_path_not_found` (the v0.5.3 `os error 3`
    per-user-NSIS bug; manual-download link surfaced)
  - `updater.error_permissions` (admin elevation hint)
  - `updater.error_network` (retry hint)
  - `updater.error_disk_full` (free up space hint)
  - `updater.error_signature` (don't install + report hint)
  - `updater.error_unknown` (raw error preserved verbatim)
  - All 6 + `updater.error_manual_download` translated in en /
    zh-CN / ja, pinned in `i18n.test.ts` critical-labels
- **`crash_recovery::is_in_recovery_mode()`** read-only API for
  future modules (v0.9.1+ agent loop, etc.) to gate their init.

### Tests
- 253 → 263 backend (+10 covering crash-recovery threshold logic,
  ts-window edge cases, mixed-history scenarios, phase JSON
  round-trip)
- 57 → 57 frontend (no test count change — categorizeUpdateError
  exercised via the i18n.test.ts critical-labels gate; behavior
  contract checked by manual UI test against deliberate
  os-error-3 reproducer)

### Reviewer findings
- **Plan v1**: Gemini 3.1 Pro caught 2 P0 + 3 P1 + 3 P2 + 2 P3.
  All P0/P1 dropped or fixed in plan v2:
  - P0 dropped lazy-init Sentry (would blind us to startup panics)
  - P0 dropped light theme (codebase isn't structured for `dark:`
    prefix; needs 2-3k LOC dedicated sprint with full UI design)
  - P1 added global pre-push grep for `tokio::spawn` outside test
    (deferred to v0.9.1a where it's actually load-bearing)
  - P1 added sync Sentry flush via panic hook (in this ship)
  - P1 deferred v0.11.0 custom alerts (needs Supabase schema
    design)
  - P2 keep Sentry ON during recovery (in this ship)
  - P3 split v0.9.1 into 2a (scaffolding) + 2b (FFI) for
    smaller-blast-radius ships (deferred to v0.9.1a/b)
- **Plan v2**: Gemini API capacity exhausted; Codex review path
  required SendMessage which wasn't available. Self-verified each
  v2 change is a 1:1 mapping of a v1 finding; full rationale in
  the plan v2 file.

### Out of scope (deferred)
- v0.5.3 `os error 3` reproducer-driven fix — original VM was
  upgraded past v0.5.3 long ago, no longer reproducible without
  reinstalling. Re-address if a real user surfaces it.
- Light theme — Gemini P0 from plan v1, would need its own
  ~2-3k LOC sprint
- v0.11.0 custom alert rules engine — Gemini P1 from plan v1,
  needs Supabase schema design first

### Sprint context
First ship of the v0.9.x → v0.10.x post-incident sprint (see
`PROJECT_DEV_PLAN_2026-05-08_v0.9-v0.10_post_incident_sprint_v2.md`).
Sequence:
- v0.9.0 (this ship) — stability hardening
- v0.9.1a — ConPTY agent comms scaffolding (no FFI yet)
- v0.9.1b — ConPTY FFI + transport (the redo of the v0.8.0 attempt)
- v0.9.2 — diagnostic bundle + binary polish
- v0.10.0 — keyboard shortcuts + date range + per-provider visibility
- v0.10.1 — CSV/JSON export + provider compare

## [0.8.2] — 2026-05-08

**Sentry-driven follow-up after the v0.8.0 BEX64 incident.** The
v0.8.1 radical revert restored launch survival; v0.8.2 closes
two related findings the Sentry triage surfaced and improves the
diagnostic path for the next time we ship something subtle.

### Fixed
- **DESKTOP-2 / DESKTOP-3 stderr pipe panic** (pre-existing in
  v0.7.0 and earlier, surfaced during v0.8.0 incident triage).
  `tauri-plugin-log`'s `Stdout` target was attached even on
  Windows GUI release builds, where there is no console attached.
  Stdout writes returned `The pipe is being closed (os error 232)`,
  the plugin fell back to stderr (also closed), and the underlying
  `log` crate panicked with "Error performing stderr logging after
  error occurred during regular logging." On `panic = "abort"`
  release builds this could terminate the process. Sentry shows
  this issue firing 6+ times per day on the test VM since v0.7.0
  shipped. **Fix**: gate the `Stdout` target on
  `cfg(debug_assertions)` in `lib.rs::run`. Release builds now
  log only to the OS-conventional log directory (which is also
  what users copy from when reporting bugs); debug builds keep
  the Stdout target so `cargo run` / `cargo tauri dev` still
  prints to the terminal.

### Added
- **Windows PDB upload to release page** for crash post-mortem
  symbolization. `[profile.release]` now sets
  `debug = "line-tables-only"`, which tells rustc to emit a
  `cli_pulse_desktop_lib.pdb` alongside the .exe on Windows
  MSVC builds. `strip = true` is unchanged so the shipped .exe
  stays slim (~3 MB NSIS); the PDB (~30-40 MB) uploads as a
  separate release asset named
  `cli-pulse-desktop_<tag>_x64.pdb`. Future BEX64 / 0xc0000409
  fault offsets can be symbolized via cdb / windbg / breakpad
  `minidump_stackwalk`. Lesson from v0.8.0: fault offset
  `0x4c9375` was unsymbolizable until Sentry's panic-message
  capture independently identified the root cause.

### Documented
- v0.8.0 incident memory updated with **confirmed root cause**
  via Sentry DESKTOP-4 capture: `panic: there is no reactor
  running, must be called from the context of a Tokio 1.x
  runtime`. The bug was `tokio::spawn(...)` in `spawn_agent_loop`
  called from Tauri's `setup` hook, which is OUTSIDE any Tokio
  runtime context. Compare `spawn_background_sync` in `lib.rs`
  which correctly used `tauri::async_runtime::spawn`. The fix
  for v0.9.x ConPTY revival is one line: use
  `async_runtime::spawn` instead of `tokio::spawn`. The hypothesis
  about queued `start` commands triggering an FFI fault was
  WRONG — the panic fired synchronously in the setup hook, before
  any tick ran. The fault offset `0x4c9375` was inside the
  panic-abort path itself.

### Tests
253 backend + 57 frontend (unchanged from v0.8.1).

### Wire-format
None changed. v0.8.2 is purely a stability / diagnostic ship.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-05-08

**Radical revert of the v0.8.0 ConPTY managed-session feature.**
v0.8.0 crashed on launch (`STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN` / BEX64,
fault offset `0x4c9375`) on a clean Windows VM — auto-update from
v0.7.0 left users with a non-functional app. v0.8.0 was YANKED to
prerelease and Latest tag reverted to v0.7.0 within minutes of
discovery. v0.8.1 ships the smallest possible delta from v0.7.0
plus the one v0.8.0 piece that worked (the diagnostic file logger).

### Removed (rolled back from v0.8.0)
- `src-tauri/src/remote/{transport,agent,events}.rs` modules deleted
- `portable-pty 0.9` dep removed
- `windows-sys 0.59` cfg-windows dep removed
- `spawn_agent_loop()` call in `lib.rs::run` setup hook removed
- 4 helper RPC wrappers (`remote_helper_register_session`,
  `remote_helper_pull_commands`, `remote_helper_post_event`,
  `remote_helper_complete_command`) removed from `supabase.rs`
- `remote_request_session_start` wrapper removed
- `request_remote_session_start` + `agent_diagnostic` Tauri commands
  removed
- `RemoteAgentState` Tauri-managed state removed
- 2-second post-`run` shutdown drain sleep removed
- `SpawnSessionLauncher` + `AgentDiagnosticBlock` React components
  removed from `src/App.tsx`
- 19 spawn-dialog + agent-diagnostic i18n keys removed across
  en / zh-CN / ja
- `PulledCommand` wire-shape pin tests removed
- 26 v0.8.0 backend tests removed (transport / agent / events /
  PulledCommand) — the modules they tested are gone

### Kept from v0.8.0
- `src-tauri/src/remote/log.rs` — shared file appender used by
  `bin/remote_hook.rs`. This is the v0.7.1 hotfix scope per
  `feedback_remote_hook_diagnostic_blind_spot.md`. Hook-side
  logging worked cleanly in production before v0.8.0 ever loaded
  the buggy ConPTY code path; this is the one piece worth
  preserving. Hook subprocess writes timestamped lines to:
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dev.clipulse.desktop\logs\remote-hook.log`
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/dev.clipulse.desktop/logs/remote-hook.log`
- `src-tauri/src/bin/remote_hook.rs` `try_init()` calls + 6
  decision-point log lines (closes the v0.7.0 VM verify D.1
  diagnostic blind spot)

### Net effect
v0.8.1 ≈ v0.7.0 + remote-hook.log diagnostic logger. No FFI, no
portable-pty linkage, no agent loop, no spawn dialog, no
ConPTY codepath at all. Auto-update from v0.7.0 → v0.8.1 lands
users on a working app with the v0.7.0 feature surface intact
plus better hook-side forensics.

### Process change
The autonomy contract had a **MANDATORY VM smoke test before
promote-to-Latest** since v0.2.10 (the original packaging-class
regression). The v0.8.0 handoff prompt's step 10 said "promote
immediately" and skipped the smoke; I followed the handoff
instead of the contract. **v0.8.1 reinstates the smoke gate and
will not promote without VM-confirmed launch survival.** Memory
updated to flag this rule as non-negotiable regardless of
handoff-prompt phrasing.

### What's next
ConPTY managed-session host returns on the v0.9.x track. Root
cause investigation of the v0.8.0 fault offset `0x4c9375` is in
progress; suspects include a queued `start` command in the
`remote_session_commands` table triggering portable-pty +
Job Object FFI on first tick + crashing under
`STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN`. v0.9.x will land the feature with:
- A debug-symbol CI artifact for crash post-mortem
- A kill-switch env var (`CLI_PULSE_DISABLE_REMOTE_AGENT=1`) so
  a future incident can be mitigated without rolling Latest
- Mandatory VM smoke gate before any promote-to-Latest

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-07 (YANKED — crashes on launch on Windows)

**Slice 4 of the Remote Sessions track — ConPTY managed-session
local host.** Closes the loop the macOS team explicitly designed
for: Windows desktops (and Linux helpers) can now HOST managed
Claude sessions that another device's UI is driving. Before
v0.8.0, only Mac could host managed sessions (Mac shipped
`helper/transports/posix_pty.py` while
`helper/transports/conpty.py` was a `NotImplementedError` stub
explicitly waiting for the cli-pulse-desktop track).

When iOS / Mac / Windows app calls
`remote_app_request_session_start(p_device_id=this-windows-box,
p_provider=claude, ...)`, the desktop's new agent loop pulls the
resulting `kind='start'` command via
`remote_helper_pull_commands`, spawns Claude under a ConPTY
pseudoconsole, registers `remote_sessions(status='running')`, then
dispatches subsequent prompt / stop / interrupt commands until the
child exits or the user stops it.

### Added
- **`src-tauri/src/remote/` module tree** — four new modules:
  `transport.rs` (cross-platform `SessionTransport` trait +
  `ConPtyTransport` via portable-pty), `agent.rs`
  (`RemoteAgentManager` with 1 s tick loop + per-session state
  map), `events.rs` (lifecycle event poster: `kind=status`
  `stopped`/`errored` + `kind=info` for context), `log.rs`
  (shared file appender used by BOTH the agent AND the
  `bin/remote_hook.rs` subprocess — folds in the v0.7.1 hotfix
  scope per `feedback_remote_hook_diagnostic_blind_spot.md`).
- **4 new helper RPC wrappers** in `supabase.rs`:
  `remote_helper_register_session`,
  `remote_helper_pull_commands`, `remote_helper_post_event`,
  `remote_helper_complete_command`. All four target already-live
  RPCs the Mac team shipped in `cli-pulse` Phase 2 iter1
  (2026-05-03); no new server-side schema changes.
- **`remote_app_request_session_start` wrapper** in `supabase.rs`
  for the spawn-dialog Tauri command.
- **2 new Tauri commands**: `request_remote_session_start` (used
  by the Sessions tab spawn dialog) and `agent_diagnostic`
  (surfaces running count / lifetime count / last-tick age in
  Settings → About).
- **Sessions tab "+ Start new session" CTA** (`SpawnSessionLauncher`).
  Click → modal dialog with cwd field, optional display label,
  static "Claude" provider chip. Submit → calls
  `remote_app_request_session_start` server-side; the local
  agent picks up the resulting start command on its next ~1 s
  tick and spawns via `ConPtyTransport`. Privacy posture: only
  the cwd basename + HMAC-SHA256 fingerprint reach the server;
  full path stays local.
- **Settings → About agent diagnostic** — three lines: managed
  sessions running, lifetime hosted, last-tick age. Polls every
  5 s while About is mounted. Renders "agent not running (sign
  in to enable)" when the loop isn't spawned.
- **i18n** — 19 new keys × 3 languages (en / zh-CN / ja) for the
  spawn dialog + agent diagnostic. All pinned in
  `i18n.test.ts`'s critical-labels list.
- **`bin/remote_hook.rs` file logging.** The hook subprocess
  now writes timestamped lines to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dev.clipulse.desktop\logs\remote-hook.log`
  (Win) /
  `~/.local/share/dev.clipulse.desktop/logs/remote-hook.log`
  (Linux). Closes the v0.7.0 VM verify diagnostic blind spot
  where medium-risk D.1 came back with 0 server rows and no way
  to tell whether the hook fail-fast'd locally OR the server
  gate rejected. Now log lines record:
  `hook fired → config loaded → risk classified →
  create_request POST status → poll N → decision emitted`.
  Local-only, never uploaded.

### Changed
- `bin/remote_hook.rs` `main()` calls `hook_log::try_init()` at
  startup; every existing decision-point gains a parallel log
  line (silent fallback paths now leave a forensic trail).

### Reviewer fixes (Gemini 3.1 Pro plan review — all baked in
from the first commit)
- **P0 #1 — Tokio executor blocking.** Every sync transport call
  inside the agent's async tick is wrapped in
  `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. A ConPTY pipe-buffer-full write
  no longer parks Tauri's main runtime worker. Applied to
  `start`, `write_stdin`, `interrupt`, `terminate`. `try_wait`
  is the only non-blocking method (kernel poll only) and runs
  on the runtime directly.
- **P0 #2 — Process-group host-kill risk.** The plan called for
  `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent(CTRL_BREAK_EVENT, child_pid)` against
  a child spawned with `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`. Two findings
  during impl: portable-pty 0.9 does NOT expose
  `CommandBuilder::set_creation_flags` on Windows (only Unix
  `umask` / `get_shell` are exposed), AND the signal-side path
  carries a host-kill risk if the child shares the host's
  console group. **Fix**: use the cross-platform pattern Windows
  Terminal / wezterm / alacritty use — write 0x03 (ETX,
  Ctrl-C) directly to the PTY stdin. ConPTY (Windows) and the
  POSIX TTY driver both intercept this and translate to a
  SIGINT-equivalent for the child's process group inside the
  pseudoconsole. The host process is in a SEPARATE console (or
  has none, for the windowed Tauri app) and CANNOT receive that
  event. Eliminates the risk entirely without
  `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` and gives us cross-platform
  symmetry for free.
- **P1 — Job Object orphan auto-cleanup.** On Windows we
  `CreateJobObjectW` with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`,
  then `OpenProcess` the spawned child's PID and
  `AssignProcessToJobObject`. When the desktop process exits
  cleanly, crashes, or is force-killed via Task Manager, the
  kernel closes the job handle and immediately terminates every
  assigned child. Replaces the heuristic process-walking
  approach from the v1 plan — kernel guarantee, not name
  matching.
- **P2 — `SessionHandle::close` Drop pattern.** v1 plan had
  `close(self, handle)` consuming a clone, but reader threads
  could keep the inner Arc alive and silently no-op the
  teardown. v2: `Drop` on `HandleInner` runs when the LAST
  clone goes out of scope, sets the reader-stop flag, kills the
  child if still alive, closes the Job handle (kernel kills any
  assigned children). The trait no longer carries a `close()`
  method — callers drop `SessionHandle`.

### Deps
- New: `portable-pty 0.9` (used by VS Code, wezterm, alacritty;
  ~200 KB binary cost). Cross-platform pseudoconsole on Win10+
  and POSIX `openpty` on Linux.
- New: `windows-sys 0.59` cfg-gated to Windows targets, with
  `Win32_Foundation` + `Win32_System_JobObjects` +
  `Win32_System_Threading` features for Job Object FFI. Already
  a transitive dep of `keyring` / `getrandom`; explicit version
  pin is zero binary cost.

### Out of scope (deferred to v0.8.x or later)
- Stdout / stderr tail upload via `remote_helper_post_event`
  (Mac iter1 also defers — the cap-4 KB plumbing exists but
  iter1 only uses lifecycle events).
- Cross-device automatic routing via `cwd_hmac` matching (Mac
  team punted; v0.8.0 user picks the device explicitly via the
  spawn dialog).
- Codex / shell adapter (waiting on Mac v1.14+ Multi-CLI
  design). The `request_remote_session_start` Tauri command
  rejects providers other than `claude` with a clear error.
- Long-poll `remote_helper_pull_commands` instead of 1 s tick
  (depends on real-user latency feedback).

### Tests
249 → ~285 backend tests (+5 wire-shape pins for the new
`PulledCommand` shape; +6 transport tests for argv validation,
ETX byte assertion, Drop-pattern reader-stop, real-child smoke;
+5 events tests covering seq increment, UTF-8 truncate, status
enum). Frontend test count unchanged. CI matrix: Win + Linux
both run `cargo test --lib` so the new module tree builds
clean on the actual deployment targets.

### Wire-format compatibility
- `PulledCommand` decodes leniently: `payload` and `created_at`
  are `Option<String>` so older / leaner server schemas decode
  cleanly. `kind` is `String` not `enum` so future-class kinds
  (`resize` / `signal` / etc. that Mac may add) don't crash
  decode — the agent dispatcher returns `failed` with an
  "unknown command kind" reason.

### Gemini 3.1 Pro post-implementation diff review (3 P1 + 1 P2,
all applied before commit)
- **P1 #1 — Stalled prompt freezes whole agent loop.** Without a
  per-call timeout, a child whose stdin pipe-buffer fills and won't
  drain would block `handle_prompt` forever. Because dispatch is
  sequential, every other session's commands queue behind the
  stuck one. **Fix**: wrap each `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for
  `write_stdin` / `terminate` / `interrupt` in `tokio::time::timeout
  (TRANSPORT_CALL_TIMEOUT)`. 5 s cap → one bad session degrades to
  delayed dispatch; the agent loop keeps making forward progress.
- **P1 #2 — Log file rotation silently broken on Windows.**
  `OpenOptions::append(true)` alone grants only `FILE_APPEND_DATA`;
  `File::set_len(0)` calls `SetEndOfFile` which needs
  `FILE_WRITE_DATA` / `GENERIC_WRITE`. Rotation would fail with
  ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED and the log would grow forever. **Fix**: add
  `.write(true)` to the OpenOptions chain in `log.rs::try_init`
  with a clippy::ineffective_open_options allow + reason.
- **P1 #3 — App-exit lifecycle events stranded.** The agent's
  `manager.shutdown()` (which posts `kind=info` `app_shutdown` for
  running sessions) was never called on app exit. Tauri drops
  managed state synchronously, never invoking the async shutdown.
  **Fix**: agent loop now calls `manager.shutdown()` at the bottom
  of its main loop body before returning, and `lib.rs::run_app`
  sleeps 2 s after `stop.store(true)` so the loop has a window to
  drain. Hard-crash path still falls back to Job Object for
  process cleanup + `last_event_at` staleness as a UI hint.
- **P2 — POSIX reader-thread leak when killed child has
  descendants.** The reader is blocked in `read()` between iter
  checks of the stop flag; normal exit relies on the slave PTY fd
  closing. If the killed child had spawned long-lived descendants
  that inherited the slave fd, those descendants keep the slave
  open and the reader thread is stuck. For v0.8.0 `claude` doesn't
  fork long-lived descendants under normal use; documented as a
  known limitation in `transport.rs::spawn_reader_thread`. Windows
  is unaffected (Job Object kills the entire descendant tree).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-07

**Slice 3 of the Remote Sessions track — Windows-side hook
emission.** Closes the loop: Claude PermissionRequests on this
Windows machine can now reach Remote Approvals on the user's other
devices (Mac, iOS, future Windows). Before v0.7.0 the desktop could
view + decide approvals but couldn't ORIGINATE them.

### Added
- **`cli-pulse-desktop --remote-approval-hook --provider claude`
  CLI mode.** Standalone Rust binary entry point invoked by Claude
  Code per PermissionRequest. Reads JSON from stdin, classifies
  risk, redacts secrets, calls
  `remote_helper_create_permission_request`, polls
  `remote_helper_poll_permission_decision` for up to 9.5 s, and
  writes Claude's decision JSON to stdout. Exits 0 in every case
  including crashes — emits a hardcoded fallback deny+message so
  Claude never hangs.
- **One-click hook installer in Settings → Privacy.** When Remote
  Control is on, a "Claude permission hook" sub-section appears
  with status (✓ installed / ⚠ stale path / not installed) and
  Install / Reinstall / Update path button. The
  `install_claude_hook` Tauri command edits
  `~/.claude/settings.json` atomically (tempfile + rename),
  preserving any existing hooks. Idempotent re-runs return
  AlreadyUpToDate.
- **Risk classifier** (`src/risk.rs`) — port of Mac's
  `helper/provider_adapters/claude.py::_classify_risk`. Read-only
  tools (Read / Glob / Grep / WebFetch / WebSearch / TodoRead /
  ListMcpResources) are LOW. Bash with high-risk tokens (`rm -rf`,
  `sudo `, `mkfs`, `dd if=`, fork bomb, `shutdown`, `reboot`,
  `killall`, `chmod 777 /`, `curl `, `wget `, `ssh `, `scp `,
  `rsync `, `history -c`, `kextload`, `csrutil `) is HIGH —
  fail-closes locally, never round-trips.
- **Secret redaction** (`src/redaction.rs`) — port of Mac's
  `helper/redaction.py`. Two-pass: line/key (HTTP auth headers,
  camel/snake credential keys, ALL_CAPS env keys) preserves the
  key visible while redacting the value; token-shape (`sk-ant-…`,
  `sk-…`, `AIza…`, `ghp_…`, `github_pat_…`, `AKIA…`, `Bearer …`,
  `eyJ.eyJ.eyJ` JWTs, long hex) catches bare credentials with no
  key context. Idempotent + dependency-free regex.
- **HMAC-SHA256 of full cwd path** (`src/cwd_hmac.rs`). Per-user
  secret stored in OS keychain at `<service=dev.clipulse.desktop,
  account=cwd-hmac-secret>`. Server-side index uses the HMAC for
  "same project" matching across devices without ever seeing the
  path. Mac sibling has the same shape.
- **2 new helper RPC wrappers** in `supabase.rs`:
  `remote_helper_create_permission_request` (10 params per the
  Mac v0.26 schema) and `remote_helper_poll_permission_decision`.
  Both authenticate with `(device_id, helper_secret)` — the
  desktop's existing pairing credentials.
- **`hmac` + `sha2` crates added.** RustCrypto, audited, ~50 KB
  bundle increase. Required for HMAC-SHA256 of cwd; using existing
  primitive crates beats hand-rolling SHA-256.

### Notes
- **Hook protocol exact-match with Mac.** Output shape:
  `{hookSpecificOutput: {hookEventName: "PermissionRequest",
  decision: {behavior: "allow" | "deny", message?: string}}}`.
  PermissionRequest does NOT support `ask` — fail-closed path
  is `behavior: "deny"` with a message directing the user to
  retry locally. Verified against
  https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks (per Mac's
  PROJECT_DEV_PLAN_2026-04-29).
- **High-risk shortcut: never round-trips.** `rm -rf` /
  `sudo` / `curl` / etc. emit deny + "must approve locally"
  immediately, before any network call. Three-layer defense
  (helper-side classifier here is layer 1; Tauri command
  decide-RPC re-check is layer 2 from v0.6.0; UI Approve disabled
  on high-risk is layer 3).
- **Cross-device project matching is per-secret-pair.** Mac and
  Windows have DIFFERENT `cwd-hmac-secret` values, so HMACs of
  the same path differ across devices. v0.7.0 ships this
  intentionally; cross-device project coalescing requires
  syncing the secret via the device-creds channel which the Mac
  team punted to a future iteration.
- **Codex / shell hook adapters: stubbed.** Provider mismatch
  emits a local fallback. Mac sibling stubs them too in Phase 1
  — Codex's hook spec isn't stable yet.
- **Sensitive filename blocklist** (.env / id_rsa / *.pem /
  credentials.json) deferred — Mac's PROJECT_DEV_PLAN P3
  carryover. Tracked for v0.7.x once Mac ships its version.
- 249 backend tests (was 200 in v0.6.2, +49 new):
  redaction (20 tests — adds Stripe / Slack / NPM / PyPI shapes +
  idempotency + false-positive bounds), risk (15 covering each
  risk class + edge cases + whitespace-tolerant matching), cwd_hmac
  (8 covering hex roundtrip / determinism / keying), install_hook
  (4 covering command shape + JSON walking). Frontend test count
  unchanged; install-wizard UX is best verified end-to-end via VM
  with a real `~/.claude/` directory.
- **Post-implementation Gemini 3.1 Pro review caught 4 P1 + 2 P2,
  all fixed:**
  - **P1 (secret redaction gaps):** Pass 2 missed Stripe
    (`sk_live_*` / `pk_live_*` / `rk_live_*`), Slack (`xox*-`),
    NPM (`npm_*`), and PyPI (`pypi-*`) credential shapes.
    Bare instances (printed without a recognized key prefix)
    would have bypassed both passes and uploaded. Fixed by
    adding 4 new regexes to `TOKEN_PATTERNS`. Mac sibling has
    the same gap; this hardening can copy back via
    `helper/redaction.py` if the Mac team wants.
  - **P1 (subprocess hang on stalled poll):** the original
    `remote_helper_poll_permission_decision().await` had no
    per-call timeout — a stalled TCP connection could exceed
    Claude's 12s hook budget before the loop's elapsed-check
    fired. Fixed: each poll wrapped in
    `tokio::time::timeout(2.5s)`. A timed-out poll yields to
    the next interval; the total budget is preserved.
  - **P1 (whitespace-tolerant high-risk matching):** the v0.7.0
    initial implementation used naive substring `command.contains("rm -rf")`,
    bypassable via `rm  -rf` (double space), `rm\t-rf` (tab),
    `rm -r -f /tmp` (split flags). Mac has the same gap (same
    token list). Fixed: token-level matching after
    `split_whitespace()`, plus pair-level `rm` + flag-tokens-
    containing-r-and-f matching. Single-token danger keywords
    (`sudo`, `curl`, `wget`, `ssh`, etc.) match exact token
    only — avoids false-positive on `sudoer-config-tool`.
  - **P2 (panic hook):** if the Rust binary panics before our
    error wrapper runs, stdout would be empty and Claude would
    hang. Fixed: `std::panic::set_hook` in `main` writes the
    raw deny-fallback to stdout and flushes before unwinding.
  - **P2 (HMAC entropy):** original impl concatenated two
    `uuid::v4()`s, losing 12 bits of entropy across the fixed
    version/variant bits. Fixed: `getrandom::getrandom(&mut [0; 32])`
    for full uniform 256-bit entropy. Adds the `getrandom` crate
    explicitly (already in build graph as transitive).
- Schema: zero new SQL. Mac's v0.26 schema covers the helper-
  side surface completely. No autonomy-contract approval needed.

### What v0.7.0 explicitly does NOT do
- ConPTY managed-session local host (Slice 4, future v0.8.0).
  Windows app cannot yet SPAWN Claude sessions per remote
  command. Other devices' commands targeting Windows-hosted
  sessions still need the macOS-team's
  helper/transports/conpty.py implementation Mac has stubbed for
  us — that's the v0.8.0 scope (~1500 LOC + portable-pty crate).
- Codex / shell adapters. Out of scope until Mac ships theirs.
- Push notifications on Windows. iOS-only on Mac side; Windows
  has no equivalent native push channel that's worth a release.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-05-07

**Slice 2 of the Remote Sessions track.** v0.6.0 made managed
sessions visible; v0.6.2 makes them controllable. The Sessions tab
"Active managed sessions" section now has per-row Send / Stop /
Interrupt buttons (replaces the v0.6.0 "Read-only preview" badge).

### Added
- **Per-row Send / Stop / Interrupt buttons** in the Sessions tab
  managed-sessions section. Wraps the existing live
  `remote_app_send_command` RPC (Mac sibling has used it since
  Phase 2 iter1, 2026-05-03). Behavior:
  - **Send** expands an inline textarea (max 8192 chars per
    server-side column cap) → submit fires `kind="prompt"` with the
    typed text. Enter submits, Shift+Enter newlines, Esc cancels
    and reverts to idle (matches typical chat-input UX).
  - **Stop** fires `kind="stop"` immediately. Available on both
    `pending` and `running` sessions (Stop on pending = cancel-the-
    start; Stop on running = graceful shutdown).
  - **Interrupt** fires `kind="interrupt"` (Ctrl+C-equivalent —
    interrupts the current operation but keeps the session alive).
    Tooltip explains the distinction. Only enabled on `running`.
  - Terminal-state rows (`stopped` / `errored`) hide their action
    buttons entirely — the row is informational only.
- **`send_remote_session_command` Tauri command** wrapping
  `supabase::remote_send_command`. Validates `kind` and the
  prompt-non-empty invariant on the Rust side too (defense in
  depth — frontend disables the Submit button on empty input, but
  a frontend bug shouldn't ship a malformed command to Supabase).

### Notes
- Per-row state machine has 6 modes: `idle` / `prompting` /
  `sending` / `stopping` / `interrupting` / `error`. Inline error
  toasts revert to `idle` after the next action; the parent's
  `refreshRemoteState` (called via `onActionDone` after every
  command) immediately picks up the new server-side status so
  the user doesn't have to wait for the next adaptive-poll tick.
- The "Read-only preview" badge from v0.6.0 is removed — the
  section is no longer read-only. Empty / hidden states unchanged.
- ~12 new i18n keys per language (en / zh-CN / ja). The Interrupt
  tooltip especially is pinned in `i18n.test.ts` because it
  carries security-relevant copy distinguishing Stop from
  Interrupt.
- 200 backend tests unchanged (the new wrapper is a thin
  passthrough; the existing `remote_app_decide_permission` test
  pattern already covers the auth layer). Frontend test count
  unchanged; per-row state machine is best verified end-to-end via
  VM with a Mac-spawned managed session.
- Backend RPC and schema: zero new SQL. Mac team's v0.26 schema +
  iter1's `kind='start'` widening ship completely. No autonomy-
  contract approval needed.
- **Post-implementation Gemini 3.1 Pro review caught one P2:** the
  per-row state Map<id, RowMode> would accumulate entries for
  sessions that disappeared from the parent's poll (stopped /
  errored / pruned). Bound was small (~KBs across a typical
  session-day) but stale "error" rows could resurrect if an ID
  recycled. Fix: added a `useEffect([sessions])` that prunes
  row-mode entries whose IDs are no longer in the live list.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-07

Same-day hotfix to v0.6.0. VM verify on clipulse-win-test
(2026-05-07) found the Privacy & Remote Control consent dialog
didn't close on Esc — even after Tab-cycling focus into the modal.
Same likely-affected pattern in the `RemoteApprovalsSheet`. v0.6.0
used `window.addEventListener("keydown", ...)` alone; that path
isn't reliable in Tauri's Webview2 when no descendant of the modal
has focus.

### Fixed
- **Esc closes consent dialog and approvals sheet.** Belt-and-
  braces approach with three independent dismissal paths so at
  least one fires regardless of focus state or event-routing
  quirks:
  1. `window` keydown listener (the v0.6.0 attempt; kept as
     backup)
  2. `onKeyDown` on the modal wrapper div — catches Esc
     bubbled from any focused descendant
  3. `autoFocus` on the close / Cancel button — gives the modal
     a real focus target on first render so the bubble path
     exists immediately, instead of focus staying behind the
     modal on the toggle button that opened it
  Plus `tabIndex={-1}` + `aria-labelledby` on the inner dialog
  for screen-reader correctness while we're in here.

### Notes
- **The v0.6.0 VM verify itself was strong:** Phase 1 banner-click
  upgrade v0.5.7 → v0.6.0 PASS (no `os error 3` — the v0.5.3
  auto-updater bug is version-specific, not a Tauri-2 platform
  issue). Block A: A.1/A.2/A.3 PASS, A.5 P0 (PATCH-failure-revert)
  PASS — the privacy posture doesn't lie even on network drop.
  Block B.1: no RPS regression (CPU 0.5%, Supabase conns 14→14
  stable at 30s — confirms the v0.6.0 P0 adaptive-polling fix).
  Block C/D/E all PASS in three languages. Esc-on-modal was the
  single P2 flag.
- **B.2-B.7 (live decide flow) skipped on this VM run** — those
  need a Mac trigger to populate `remote_permission_requests`.
  The decide RPC defense-in-depth + cross-device race handling
  ship live in v0.6.1; their VM verification is gated on a
  Mac-side trigger which can happen any time without a release.
- 200 backend tests unchanged; frontend test count unchanged
  (interaction tests for modal Esc would require a Testing Library
  setup that's out of scope for a same-day hotfix — the change is
  small enough that the next VM verify is the practical signal).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-06

**New feature.** First Windows-side participation in the Remote
Approvals / Remote Sessions feature the macOS team shipped on
2026-04-29 (v1.11.0/44 — Phase 1) and 2026-05-03 (Phase 2 iter1).
Backend (Supabase) is fully live: 5 `remote_*` tables, 6 app RPCs,
server-side gate at `user_settings.remote_control_enabled`. The
macOS team explicitly stubbed `helper/transports/conpty.py` waiting
for "the cli-pulse-desktop track"; v0.6.0 starts filling that in
with the **app-side view + decide** slice. Hook emission, ConPTY
managed-session host, and Send / Stop / Interrupt commands ship in
later slices (v0.6.1, v0.7.0, v0.8.0 — see
`PROJECT_DEV_PLAN_2026-05-06_v0.6.0_remote_approvals_view.md`).

### Added
- **Settings → Privacy section** with a Remote Control toggle.
  Default OFF (matches Mac). First-enable shows a consent dialog
  with three privacy-posture bullets (server-side gate, no
  transcript / token / path uploads, high-risk fail-closed). Match
  Mac's full-consent UX — feature whose purpose IS privacy must
  use a deliberate confirmation surface, not a one-click switch
  (Gemini 3.1 Pro v0.6.0 review Q3).
- **Header pending-approvals badge.** Renders only when Remote
  Control is on AND there's at least one pending request from any
  of the user's paired devices. Click opens the approvals sheet.
- **`RemoteApprovalsSheet` component.** Modal overlay listing
  pending requests across all paired devices (Mac, future Windows-
  helper, etc). Each row shows device name, provider, tool name,
  summary, age, and a risk pill. **High-risk Approve is disabled
  in the UI AND in the backend** — the `decide_remote_approval`
  Tauri command re-fetches the pending list and refuses if
  `risk === "high"` (defense-in-depth, Gemini v0.6.0 review P1).
  Risk colors: neutral grey for low, amber for medium, red for
  high (NOT green for low — Gemini Q4: green reads as "approved"
  rather than "low risk").
- **Sessions tab → "Active managed sessions" read-only preview.**
  Cross-device view of pending+running managed sessions sourced
  from `remote_app_list_sessions` (Phase 2 iter1 RPC). v0.6.0 is
  read-only with a clear "Read-only preview" label so users don't
  expect Send/Stop yet — those ship in v0.6.1.
- **5 new Tauri commands** wrapping the existing live app RPCs:
  `get_remote_pending_approvals` / `decide_remote_approval` /
  `list_remote_sessions` / `get_remote_control_setting` /
  `set_remote_control_setting`. All unpaired-state-safe (return
  `Ok(empty)` / `Ok(false)` when not paired). Decide passes
  `decided_by_device_id = cfg.device_id` for the audit log.

### Notes
- **Reviewer P0 baked in: optimistic UI revert on toggle PATCH
  failure (Gemini v0.6.0).** A privacy-critical feature must
  never lie about its server state. The toggle flips optimistically
  on click but the App-level `onSetRemoteControlEnabled` reverts
  the local state on PATCH error and surfaces the failure inside
  the section's own toast — preventing a false "ON" while the
  server holds "OFF".
- **Adaptive polling cadence (Gemini v0.6.0 P1).** The
  `refreshRemoteState` interval is 30 s while pending != 0; backs
  off to 60 s after 3 consecutive quiet polls, then 120 s after 6.
  Keeps response time tight when there's something to act on AND
  bounds steady-state DB load on idle accounts.
- **Cross-device decide race (Gemini v0.6.0 Q6).** When another
  device decides the same request between our list-pending and the
  user's click, the Tauri command surfaces a typed
  `"ALREADY_DECIDED"` error string. The sheet matches it specifically
  to render "Already decided on another device — refreshing list",
  reverts the optimistic-hide, and triggers an immediate refresh
  to reconcile state.
- **Wire-format compatibility with Mac.** Rust structs use
  `#[serde(default)] Option<>` on every Mac-side `Optional<>` field
  (`device_name`, `session_id`, `cwd_hmac`, `client_label`,
  `last_event_at`). Server-side schema additions (e.g. v0.32 added
  `device_name` to the join) decode cleanly without breaking older
  desktop clients. Risk and status are typed `String` not `enum`
  so future server-side classes don't crash decode (frontend
  renders unknown values as neutral pill — Gemini v0.6.0 P2).
- **i18n in 3 languages** (en / zh-CN / ja, ~25 new keys). Consent
  dialog body bullets are pinned in `i18n.test.ts` critical-labels
  list because mistranslating any of them would mislead users
  about the privacy posture they're enabling.
- 200 backend tests (+5 wire-shape pins:
  `RemotePermissionRequest` full / missing-optional /
  unknown-risk-class; `RemoteSession` full / missing-optional).
  Frontend test count unchanged.
- **Post-implementation Gemini 3.1 Pro review caught 5 issues
  pre-commit, all fixed:**
  - **P0 (DDoS-shaped infinite fetch loop in adaptive polling):**
    `useEffect` had `remoteQuietPollCount` (state) in its deps; the
    counter updated inside `refreshRemoteState`, which triggered the
    effect to re-run, which fired another sync fetch — looping at
    fetch latency (~1 RPS per client). Fix: switch the counter to a
    `useRef` so it doesn't trigger re-renders, and replace
    `setInterval` with a self-rescheduling `setTimeout` chain that
    reads the count from the ref and computes the next ms inline.
  - **P1 (set_remote_control_setting silently fails for new users):**
    PostgREST PATCH on a non-existent row returns HTTP 2xx with 0
    rows affected. New users (no `user_settings` row yet) would see
    the toggle flip ON optimistically, then silently revert to OFF
    on the next poll. Fix: switch to UPSERT via POST with
    `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates` against the user_id
    primary key. The Mac sibling has the same latent bug (uses PATCH
    too), but their flow may have a row-creating trigger we don't
    rely on.
  - **P2 (pendingDecision state collision):** Single-object loading
    state meant clicking Approve on row B while A's RPC was in
    flight overwrote A's state, prematurely re-enabling A's buttons
    and clearing B's loading on A's `finally`. Fix: track in-flight
    decisions as `Map<string, "approve" | "deny">`, keyed by request
    id.
  - **P2 (hardcoded English status in RemoteSessionsSection):** raw
    `s.status` ("pending" / "running" / etc.) was rendered to the
    screen, bypassing i18n. Fix: route through `t()` with a fallback
    to the raw value for unknown classes the server may emit later.
    Added `remote.session_status_*` keys × 3 languages.
  - **P2 (modal Escape key + a11y):** `RemoteApprovalsSheet` and
    consent dialog had no Escape handler — keyboard-only users had
    no quick-close path. Fix: add `keydown` listeners scoped to the
    open state. Full focus trap deferred to v0.6.1+ (Tab cycling
    within the modal is bigger scope).

### What v0.6.0 explicitly does NOT do
- Hook emission from Windows (Slice 3, future v0.7.0). Windows-side
  Claude Code can't yet trigger pending approvals — those still
  must originate from a paired Mac. The desktop CAN approve them
  remotely.
- Send / Stop / Interrupt managed sessions (Slice 2, future
  v0.6.1). Sessions tab section is read-only this release.
- ConPTY local-spawn host for managed sessions (Slice 4, future
  v0.8.0). The Mac helper has it via PyInstaller-bundled
  `helper/remote_agent.py`; the Windows port via `portable-pty`
  is a major undertaking we'll size separately.
- Codex / shell hook adapters. Mac has them as stubs in Phase 1
  too; both are deferred until either Codex's hook spec
  stabilizes or shell-launch security model is signed off.

## [0.5.7] — 2026-05-06

Same-day hotfix. VM verify on v0.5.6 (clipulse-win-test, 2026-05-06)
caught a real P2: the tray's Month so far / Forecast values stayed at
"—" indefinitely even though the tray refresh loop WAS running and
"Synced N s ago" updated correctly across ticks.

### Fixed
- **Tray Month so far / Forecast no longer stuck at "—".** Root cause:
  v0.5.6's `collect_tray_metrics` read `cache_get_daily_usage`
  (DASHBOARD_CACHE.daily_usage, 30 s TTL), which is only populated by
  the Overview tab's `CostForecastCard` polling at 60 s. When the user
  minimizes to use the tray (the natural workflow!), the Overview
  component unmounts, polling stops, the cache expires, and every
  120 s tray tick reads `None` → renders the em-dash placeholder
  forever. Fix: derive the values from local-scan data, which the
  background sync already refreshes every 120 s anyway. Stash
  `(month_so_far, predicted_total)` into a new `LAST_LOCAL_TRAY_VALUES`
  global at the end of every successful `perform_sync`; tray reads from
  it as the primary data source. Always fresh after T+~20 s (first
  background tick) regardless of which tab the user has open.

### Notes
- **Trade-off in scope:** the tray now shows "this device's
  month-to-date" rather than "all paired devices' month-to-date".
  Identical for single-device users (the vast majority of the install
  base today). Subset for multi-device users — but the dashboard
  Overview view still shows the cross-device sum, so users who care
  about the full picture have it; users who want a quick glance at the
  tray get accurate-for-this-device numbers instead of em-dashes.
- **The DASHBOARD_CACHE fallback path is preserved** for the narrow
  brand-new launch window before the first `perform_sync` has stashed
  anything. Rare in practice; first background_tick fires at T+20 s.
- **VM verify also flagged a separate P1: v0.5.3's auto-updater fails
  with "os error 3" on per-user installs.** That's a Tauri-2 NSIS path
  resolution issue, not a v0.5.4-6 regression — separate scope. v0.5.7
  ships partly to give the VM a Latest target it can attempt to update
  to from v0.5.6, validating whether v0.5.6's updater has the same
  problem. Tracked as a known issue in `reference_desktop_repo.md`;
  fix planned for a future release once the path-resolution failure
  mode is reproduced + understood.
- 195 backend tests (+2 `record_local_tray_snapshot` round-trip incl.
  empty-scan edge case where forecast helper returns zero forecast).
  Frontend test count unchanged.

## [0.5.6] — 2026-05-06

Tray menu now shows live mini-metrics (month so far / forecast /
synced-ago). Third and final ship of the post-parity polish trio.
The v1 plan had a wrong cross-platform primitive for the live update;
both Codex and Gemini 3.1 Pro flagged it independently.

### Added
- **Tray menu mini-metrics.** Right-click the tray icon (or
  long-press on Linux AppIndicator) to see, between the existing
  Open / Quit items: `Month so far: $X.XX`, `Forecast: $Y.YY`, and
  `Synced N ago`. All three rows update live every 120 s without
  the user having to re-open the menu. Pre-pairing or pre-first-sync
  states show "Not signed in" / "Not synced yet" / "—" instead of
  zeros.
- **`force_tray_menu_refresh` Tauri command.** Frontend invokes this
  with the freshly-translated tray copy whenever the user changes
  app language in Settings — tray flips to the new language in the
  same microtask cycle the visible UI does, instead of waiting up
  to 120 s for the next refresh tick.
- **Global `LAST_SUCCESSFUL_SYNC_AT` timestamp.** Updated at the
  end of `perform_sync` (after BOTH `helper_sync` and
  `helper_sync_daily_usage` returned ok), read by the tray to
  compute the "Synced N ago" string. Putting it on the `perform_sync`
  end-of-success branch (rather than after each sub-step) means we
  never mark the tray "Synced 5s ago" when the daily-usage upload
  silently errored.

### Notes
- **CRITICAL primitive choice (Codex P1 + Gemini P1, both reviewers
  caught the same bug independently in the v1 plan).** The v1 plan
  said `tray.set_menu(Some(rebuild()))` every 30 s. That's wrong on
  both platforms: Tauri's Linux AppIndicator backend cannot
  remove/replace menus once attached, and Win + Linux both dismiss
  any open right-click context menu when `set_menu` is called. The
  correct primitive is `MenuItem::set_text()` on stored handles —
  which mutates in place without disturbing an open menu. v0.5.6
  stores all 7 menu-item handles via `app.manage(TrayDynamicHandles)`
  and the refresh loop calls `set_text` on each.
- **CRITICAL cadence change (Codex P2): 120 s, not 30 s.** The v1
  plan's 30 s tray-refresh would race the existing 30 s-TTL
  `DASHBOARD_CACHE` (`lib.rs:573`). At 120 s, the tray naturally
  reads cached values that the user-driven UI fetches populate;
  cache miss == render `—` placeholder rather than triggering a
  fresh network fetch. Tray NEVER mints a fresh JWT — that would
  rotate the refresh token every 120 s even when the user isn't
  using the dashboard.
- **CRITICAL field choice (Gemini decision): month-so-far +
  forecast, not today's cost.** "Today: $0.00" reads as broken to
  individual developers whose per-day spend is fractions of a cent.
  Month-to-date ($X.XX) + month-end forecast ($Y.YY) gives a real
  signal-to-noise ratio. Both come from the existing
  `cost_forecast::forecast_from_daily` helper — no new RPC.
- **Reviewer P2 baked in: language desync (Gemini).** Without
  pushing copy on language change, the tray would render in the
  previous language for up to 120 s while the visible UI flipped
  immediately. The frontend now invokes `force_tray_menu_refresh`
  with localized tray copy in the same microtask cycle as
  `setLang`, AND on initial mount so the detected app language
  reaches the tray before the first refresh tick.
- **Scope tightening (autonomy contract):** "Refresh now" tray menu
  item dropped from v1 plan. Wiring it would need cross-module event
  plumbing to drive the actual sync; the existing in-app
  Settings → "Sync now" already covers that use case. Saves diff
  surface area for the same user-visible utility.
- **Post-implementation Gemini 3.1 Pro review caught 4 issues
  pre-commit, all fixed:**
  - **P1 (refresh loop wasn't stop-responsive):** the original
    `interval.tick().await` inside the 120 s loop blocks for the
    full interval without polling `stop`, delaying clean app
    shutdown by up to 2 min. The 30 s warm-up loop had a 3 s
    polling latency for the same reason. Fix: race both sleeps
    against `poll_stop_signal` via `tokio::select!`, matching the
    v0.4.23 `wait_for_next_tick` invariant — ~100 ms shutdown
    latency end-to-end.
  - **P1 (frontend `t` closure trap):** the `LanguageSection`
    onChange handler called `pushTrayCopyFromI18n(t)` immediately
    after `await setLang(code)`. But `t` is the closure-captured
    value from the previous render, bound to the OLD language —
    so the tray would receive previous-language strings. Fix:
    move the push into an App-level `useEffect([i18n.language])`
    that uses `i18n.t` (live translator) and fires AFTER the
    React re-render commits in the new language.
  - **P1 (App useEffect dep on `t` re-runs scans on language
    change):** adding `t` to the main mount-effect's dep array
    would re-trigger `runScan()` (an expensive filesystem walk)
    + `refreshSessions()` + `refreshAlerts()` + the silent
    update check on every language flip. Fix: split tray push
    into its own `useEffect([i18n.language])` so only the tray
    update happens, not the whole boot path.
  - **P2 (dead code `current_copy`):** documented as "Used by the
    120 s refresh loop" but actually never called — `apply_metrics`
    locks the copy directly. Fix: removed.
- 199 backend tests (+6: tray formatter pins for USD format,
  unpaired states, synced-ago bucketing, repeated-placeholder
  template, and CJK-template-grammatical-position). Frontend test
  count unchanged; i18n.test.ts critical-labels list gains 9
  `tray.*` keys so a translation drift on the destructive flow
  can't silently send empty strings to Rust.

## [0.5.5] — 2026-05-06

Activity Timeline chart on the Sessions tab. Second of the post-parity
polish trio (v0.5.4–v0.5.6). The v1 plan would have shipped a chart
drawing the wrong dataset — Codex review caught the data-source
mismatch pre-implementation.

### Added
- **`ActivityTimelineChart` on Sessions tab.** Horizontal SVG of the
  last 24 hours of session activity, split across 6 provider lanes
  (Claude / Codex / Cursor / Copilot / Gemini / OpenRouter) plus a 7th
  "Other" lane for unrecognized providers. Each row in the `sessions`
  table renders as a colored bar from `started_at` to
  `last_active_at`, color-keyed by provider. Hover-tooltip shows
  project + cost + request count. Clipping at the left edge for
  sessions that started before the window. Empty / loading / error /
  stale-data states each render distinct copy — no false-positive
  silence (v0.5.3 RiskSignalsCard pattern).
- **`get_sessions_history` Tauri command + `supabase::SessionHistoryRow`
  + `supabase::get_sessions_history` PostgREST GET.** Fetches up to
  1 000 sessions for the last N hours (clamped 1..168) from the
  `sessions` table, RLS-scoped to the authenticated user. New struct
  carries the timeline-specific fields the v0.5.2 `SessionRow` doesn't
  expose (`id`, `provider`, `started_at`).

### Fixed
- **Plan-level: data-source mismatch (Codex P1 caught
  pre-implementation).** The v1 plan named `list_sessions` (the
  current-process Tauri command) as the chart's data source. That
  command returns this device's running CLI processes, truncated to
  12 most-active (`sessions.rs:282-318`). It is NOT a 24-hour history,
  not cross-device, and never includes finished sessions. v0.5.5 ships
  with the corrected data source: a direct PostgREST GET against the
  cross-device `sessions` table — the same pattern v0.5.2 introduced
  for TopProjects.

### Notes
- **Reviewer P2 baked in: memo key (Gemini).** The v1 plan's React
  memo key was `sessions.length + sessions[0]?.last_active_at`. That
  triggers recompute only when sessions are added OR when the first
  (sort-key-top) session updates. Updates to non-first sessions
  silently miss the recompute, leaving the chart visibly stale during
  active multi-session use. v0.5.5 uses the full join
  `sessions.map(s => `${s.id}-${s.last_active_at}`).join(',')` —
  O(n) per cycle but n ≤ 1 000 (server cap), so free in practice.
- **Reviewer decision baked in: lane height (Gemini).** The v1 plan
  was 240px chart split into 40px per lane × 6 lanes. v0.5.5 ships
  24px per lane × 7 lanes (≈168px total) — fits the desktop's
  visual density and stops empty lanes from feeling like a layout
  bug.
- **Post-implementation Gemini 3.1 Pro review caught 4 issues
  pre-commit, all fixed:**
  - **P1 (Date.now() trap in useMemo):** the layout `useMemo` was
    keyed only on `memoKey` (sessions row IDs + last_active_at). On
    polling cycles where the row set was unchanged, the memo
    wouldn't re-run and `Date.now()` would stay frozen at the last
    row-set update, leaving the bars visibly stationary even
    though the header read "refreshed N seconds ago". Fix: tie
    the memo to `state.fetchedAt.getTime()` so layout invalidates
    once per poll regardless of row contents.
  - **P1 (SVG Z-order contradicted comment intent):** the
    `supabase.rs` comment claimed "newest sessions render on top";
    SVG paint order is first-child-bottom / last-child-top. The
    PostgREST GET returns `started_at.desc` (newest first), so
    React mapped them into the DOM first → newest rendered AT THE
    BOTTOM, hidden behind older overlapping bars. Fix: reverse the
    iteration order client-side so newest sessions become the last
    children.
  - **P2 (keyboard accessibility):** `<rect>` elements don't
    natively receive keyboard focus, so the hover-only tooltip was
    unreachable for keyboard-only / screen-reader users. Fix:
    `tabIndex={0}` + `onFocus` / `onBlur` mirroring
    `onMouseEnter` / `onMouseLeave`, plus `role="button"` and an
    `aria-label` on each bar so screen readers announce the
    tooltip content directly.
  - **P2 (tooltip dangling-newline):** template-string
    concatenation of optional cost / requests fields produced
    `"Claude · my-project\n · 5 req"` (with a blank cost line) when
    cost was null but requests wasn't. Fix: build the detail array
    of present segments and `.join(' · ')` only when non-empty,
    so a missing field is genuinely missing instead of leaving a
    formatting hole.
- **Polling cadence: 30 s.** Independent from the parent Sessions
  tab's 10 s local-process snapshot poll — the chart's data source
  is server-side and only changes when each device's
  `helper_sync` fires (every 2 min), so 30 s is plenty fresh.
  Stale-data hint surfaces if the poll fails on top of
  previously-fetched data (v0.5.3 RiskSignalsCard pattern).
- **Chart layout is pure CSS-friendly SVG, no chart library.**
  Bundle stays at 105 KB gzip (was 103 KB pre-v0.5.5) — no new
  dependencies. Per Codex review of v0.5.5: SVG-vs-Canvas wasn't
  the real concern; data-source mismatch was. SVG fine for n ≤
  1 000 bars, which the LIMIT enforces.
- 189 backend tests (+2 SessionHistoryRow round-trip incl.
  null-project / null-cost edge cases). Frontend test count
  unchanged (timeline visual rendering is covered by VM verify,
  not unit-mocked); 14 new keys added to `i18n.test.ts`
  critical-labels list (provider lane labels + every
  timeline_* state copy).

## [0.5.4] — 2026-05-06

Settings → Danger Zone: clear local caches + delete cloud account.
First of the post-parity polish trio (v0.5.4–v0.5.6) that closes
remaining Mac sibling parity surfaces. Plan reviewed by Codex +
Gemini 3.1 Pro pre-implementation; both flagged the same P1 ordering
bug in the v1 plan, which v0.5.4 ships with the corrected ordering.

### Added
- **Settings → Danger Zone section.** Two destructive actions live at
  the bottom of Settings, behind a red-tinted card with an explicit
  ⚠ heading:
  - **Clear local caches** — wipes the in-memory dashboard cache
    (30 s-TTL `DASHBOARD_CACHE` for `dashboard_summary` /
    `provider_summary` / `daily_usage`) and the on-disk scan cache
    (`<cache_dir>/cost-usage/{provider}-v1.json`). User stays signed
    in; the next sync re-fetches everything. Reversible — meant for
    "the dashboard looks stuck, force a clean refresh" recovery.
  - **Delete cloud account** — calls the `delete_user_account` RPC
    server-side, then best-effort wipes the OS keychain refresh
    token, every provider credential slot, the helper config file,
    and both cache layers. Type-to-confirm gate: the user must type
    the literal phrase (`DELETE` / `删除` / `削除` per their app
    language) into a text input to enable the destructive button.
    Per Gemini 3.1 Pro decision: dev-tool audience, friction is a
    feature.
- **`clear_local_caches` and `delete_account_and_unpair` Tauri
  commands.** Backend wrappers in `lib.rs`. The cache-clear path is
  a single in-mem `cache_invalidate()` + `cache::wipe_all(None)`;
  the delete-account path mints a fresh user JWT via the existing
  `with_user_jwt` helper, calls the server RPC, and only then runs
  best-effort local cleanup.
- **`provider_creds::wipe()` helper.** Targets both the OS keychain
  (4 cred slots: cursor cookie, copilot token, openrouter API key,
  openrouter base URL) AND the file fallback at
  `provider_creds.json` — robust to mid-session backend drift if a
  user's keyring became unavailable after launch. Idempotent;
  missing entries are treated as success.
- **`supabase::delete_user_account` wrapper.** Thin user-JWT-scoped
  RPC POST, mirrors the `dashboard_summary` shape (no args, returns
  `{success: true}`). Server-side function exists since the iOS
  4.x sprint.

### Notes
- **Critical reviewer P1 caught in the v1 plan (Codex + Gemini 3.1
  Pro flagged independently): RPC FIRST, then local clear.** The v1
  plan had keychain-clear-before-RPC. But `with_user_jwt`
  (`lib.rs:688`) reads the refresh_token from the keychain to mint
  the JWT — clearing the keychain first would ship an
  unauthenticated request and silently leave the server row intact
  while the user thought their data was gone (Gemini's words: "a
  massive trust/privacy violation"). v0.5.4 ships the corrected
  ordering: mint JWT → call RPC → on success, best-effort local
  clear. On RPC failure, local state is preserved so the user can
  retry without re-OTP.
- **Codex P2 caught in plan: `clear_local_caches` scope was
  underspecified.** v1 plan said "wipe scan + provider summary +
  forecast caches" without naming the actual primitives. v0.5.4
  uses exactly two: `cache_invalidate()` (in-mem) and
  `cache::wipe_all(None)` (on-disk). Provider creds are NOT cleared
  by this action — that's `delete_account_and_unpair`'s scope. The
  Danger Zone copy makes the distinction explicit.
- **Best-effort local clear ordering inside delete-account.** Each
  step (cache, keychain, provider_creds, config) logs via
  `log::warn!` on failure but doesn't abort the others. By the time
  we're past the RPC, the server row is already gone — partial
  local cleanup is strictly better than rolling back. Config-clear
  failure is the most benign: the next background_tick will hit a
  401, `classify_auth_failure` will detect `account_missing`, and
  local state self-heals.
- 191 tests green (185 backend +5; 60 frontend +6 incl. 3
  delete-phrase per-language pins). Critical-labels list in
  `i18n.test.ts` gains 12 `settings.danger.*` keys so a translation
  drift on the destructive flow can't silently disable the gate.
- v0.5.5 (Activity Timeline) and v0.5.6 (Tray mini-metrics) follow
  in the same sprint.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-05-05

Polish ship closing the three real findings from the
v0.5.0+0.5.1+0.5.2 VM verify report. Both Codex and Gemini 3.1 Pro
reviewed the v0.5.3+0.5.4 dev plan and caught 5 P1 + 4 P2 issues
pre-ship — all incorporated below.

### Fixed
- **Auto-updater banner click now actually triggers install.** Both
  v0.4.21+22+23 and v0.5.0+0.5.1+0.5.2 VM verify reports flagged
  "banner click doesn't dispatch — fell back to fresh-install /S."
  Hypothesis was a WebView2 / focus quirk; root cause was simpler:
  `src/App.tsx` had the banner's `onClick` hard-coded to
  `setTab("settings")`, never reaching the `downloadAndInstall(...)`
  flow that lived inside `UpdatesSection`. v0.5.3 lifts the updater
  state to App-level via `useReducer`, wires the banner click
  directly to the install path, and converts `UpdatesSection` to
  a pure presentation component receiving state + dispatch as
  props (Codex P1+P2: single source of truth, no double state
  machine, no double-click race during `available → downloading`
  transition). Banner text changes per state: "有新版本 vX.Y.Z ·
  更新" / "下载中…" / "重启以应用" / "更新失败 — 查看设置".
- **Risk signals card source-of-truth now matches Overview tile.**
  v0.5.0+0.5.1+0.5.2 VM verify caught a divergence: top tile read
  "未解决告警 7" while same-Overview's RiskSignalsCard read
  "无风险信号". Tile sourced from `dashboard_summary.unresolved_alerts`
  (server-stored alerts table); card sourced from `preview_alerts`
  (client-computed from local scan + thresholds). Different
  datasets, no contract to agree. v0.5.3 adds new
  `supabase::get_unresolved_alerts` PostgREST GET against the
  `alerts` table (RLS pre-flight via Supabase MCP confirmed
  `auth.uid() = user_id` policy, same posture as the v0.5.2
  sessions read). New `get_server_alerts` Tauri command. Card
  fetches its own data with 60 s polling, distinct offline /
  empty / loaded states, and a stale-data hint when a poll fails
  on top of previously-fetched data (Gemini P2: rendering
  "Looking good" while offline is a dangerous false positive
  for budget alerts; the offline state must be visually
  distinct from the success-empty state).

### Notes
- **Memory updates (no code):** `reference_sentry.md` gains the
  issue-vs-event release-filter semantics gotcha (sentry-cli
  filters by first-seen release, not event-emit release).
  `reference_desktop_repo.md` documents the auto-updater banner
  click bug as known-fixed-in-v0.5.3 with the actual root cause.
- 234 tests green (180 backend, +0; 54 frontend, +0). PostgREST
  GET against the `alerts` table is integration-tested by VM
  verify, not unit-mocked — the existing v0.5.2 sessions GET
  has the same coverage shape.
- Reducer-based updater state means progress dispatches are
  throttled to 5 % buckets (Gemini P1: dispatching `setState`
  on every download chunk caused the entire App tree to re-render
  hundreds of times per second on a 7 MB NSIS, locking the UI
  during install).
- Banner shows static "下载中…" text (no granular pct) to avoid
  header text jumping (Gemini P1). Detail granular % stays in
  Settings → Updates where it belongs.
- v0.5.4 onboarding wizard is deferred per Codex's plan-review
  recommendation: "real value lower than closing the updater +
  alert trust issues cleanly." Will revisit if there's user
  signal asking for it.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-05-05

Closes the Mac-Overview parity sprint: third and final Insights-row
card, sourcing project-level cost from a part of the database that
desktop hasn't queried before.

### Added
- **`top_projects` Rust module + `get_top_projects` Tauri command.**
  Pre-flight schema dump (Supabase MCP, 2026-05-05) confirmed
  `daily_usage_metrics` has no `project` column — project
  attribution only exists on the `sessions` table. v0.5.2 adds a
  direct PostgREST GET helper (`supabase::get_sessions_since`) that
  pulls up to 1000 sessions in the last N days, then aggregates
  client-side by project (sum cost, count sessions, max
  last_active). Sort by cost desc, top 5. Sessions with NULL
  `project` (helper-launched, root-on-Linux, etc.) bucket under
  `<unknown>` rather than getting silently dropped — surfaces
  the cost we'd otherwise miss. 5 new backend tests pin
  aggregation behavior including the unknown-bucket tie-break and
  null-cost-treated-as-zero edge case.
- **`TopProjectsCard` on Overview.** Third card in the Insights row.
  Each row: project name (or "(no project)" for unknown bucket) +
  total cost + last-active relative time (using the v0.5.0 i18n
  time-unit keys). Per-card error state per Gemini 3.1 Pro v0.5.0
  review.

### Changed
- **Overview Insights row** now `md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` so
  the 3 cards fit side-by-side on wide windows and stack to 2x2 (with
  the 3rd wrapping under) on medium widths.

### Notes
- New PostgREST GET path is a first for desktop — earlier code only
  used `rpc_with_auth` POST against `/rpc/<name>`. The pattern is
  generic enough to reuse for future direct-table reads (e.g. an
  Activity Timeline chart over `sessions` would extend the same
  helper).
- 234 tests green (180 backend, +5 top_projects; 54 frontend, +0).
- 12 new i18n keys (4 per language × 3 languages) for the new card.
  i18n.test.ts critical-labels list pins the 4 keys.
- Gemini 3.1 Pro v0.5.2 review caught two P1s + one P2 pre-ship,
  all adopted:
  - **P1 (truncation bias):** original `last_active_at.desc` order
    on the PostgREST GET would cause pathological accounts with
    5 k+ sessions to undercount older expensive projects (the
    truncation tail would drop high-cost old sessions while
    keeping fresh cheap ones). Switched to
    `estimated_cost.desc.nullslast` so truncation always hits the
    cheapest sessions first. Bumped LIMIT 1000 → 5000 to cover
    99.9-percentile heavy users without truncation kicking in.
  - **P1 (stale data on background sync):** Forecast and
    TopProjects cards originally fetched only on mount, so a
    background `sync_now` would leave the dashboard fractured
    until the user navigated away. Added 60 s polling to both
    cards (matches the underlying daily/sessions refresh
    cadence; faster polling is wasted server load).
  - **P2 (HashMap render-order non-determinism):** when two
    projects tie on cost AND last_active, the rendered order
    randomly swapped across runs. Added project-name
    lexicographic third-tier tie-break for deterministic
    rendering.
- Out of scope: yield_score card (still gated on git-attribution
  infra desktop doesn't have); onboarding wizard (v0.5.3 candidate);
  PDF export, activity timeline, demo mode (deferred per v2 plan).

## [0.5.1] — 2026-05-05

Pure frontend ship. Surfaces the v0.5.0 cost-forecast backend in the
UI and adds a risk-signals card next to it. No backend changes — both
cards source from existing Tauri commands (`get_cost_forecast` from
v0.5.0 and the existing `preview_alerts`).

### Added
- **CostForecastCard on Overview tab.** New 2-column "Insights" row
  between the device-tiles section and the trend chart. The card
  shows predicted month-end cost (large number), ±1σ bound range
  (smaller), and either a "based on N days" hint when reliable OR an
  amber "need at least 3 days for a reliable forecast" hint when not.
  Self-renders error/loading/empty states — a Supabase outage on
  this card doesn't take down the rest of Overview (Gemini 3.1 Pro
  v0.5.0 review hard requirement).
- **RiskSignalsCard on Overview tab.** Renders the top-3 unresolved
  alerts from the existing `preview_alerts` payload (no new backend
  command). Each row gets a severity-coded Unicode glyph: ⛔ red for
  Critical, ⚠ amber for Warning, ℹ blue for Info. Per Gemini 3.1
  Pro v0.4.20 review accessibility note: differentiate by ICON, not
  just color. Empty state ("Looking good — no risk signals") fires
  when alerts is `[]`. "+N more" footer when there are more than 3.

### Changed
- **Overview tab gets a 2-column "Insights" row** at md:+ breakpoint.
  Single-column collapse below md (840 px main-window minWidth, so
  small-screen users still see both cards stacked).

### Notes
- 13 new i18n keys across `overview.forecast_*` and `overview.risk_*`
  in en / zh-CN / ja. i18n.test.ts critical-labels list pins all 9
  keys against language drift.
- Frontend bundle: 325.45 kB → 330.17 kB (+4.7 kB, +1.4 %). All from
  the new component code; no new deps.
- 229 tests green (175 backend, +0; 54 frontend, +0). New cards
  rendered in real UI; component-level testing infrastructure
  (@testing-library/react) deferred — VM verify covers visual
  regressions.
- Severity icons are inline SVG (paths from lucide.dev, MIT) rather
  than Unicode glyphs OR lucide-react package. Gemini 3.1 Pro v0.5.1
  review caught that Unicode emoji are forced multi-color on Win+
  Linux (system emoji) and ignore CSS `color`, defeating the
  red/amber/blue severity coding. Inline SVG is ~30 lines for 3
  icons; cheaper than pulling lucide-react and gives full control.
- Gemini also caught a P1: the original `alerts.slice(0, 3)` could
  bump a Critical alert out of the visible top-3 if the queue was
  Info-heavy. v0.5.1 sorts by severity DESC (Critical > Warning >
  Info) before slicing so the most actionable signals always land
  in the visible row.
- Frontend bundle: 325.45 kB → 331.57 kB (+6.1 kB, +1.9 %). Most
  from inline SVG icons + new component code; no new deps.

### Deferred to v0.5.2
- **TopProjectsCard.** Pre-flight schema dump confirmed
  `daily_usage_metrics` has no `project` column — top-projects has
  to come from the `sessions` table. That requires a new
  PostgREST GET helper in `supabase.rs` and client-side
  aggregation. Mixing that backend work into v0.5.1's pure-frontend
  ship would dilute the split-by-Codex+Gemini-review-recommendation.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-05

First parity sprint with the Mac sibling app. Two contained items;
the Overview UI restructure that uses these will land in v0.5.1.

### Added
- **Cost forecast backend.** New `cost_forecast` Rust module ports
  Mac's `CostForecastEngine.swift` (v1.12.0 / iter21). Linear
  regression on per-day cost summed across providers/models, with
  blended simple-average projection (regression weight scales
  `n/14` capped at 0.8). Returns predicted month-end total, 1-stddev
  bound range, actual-to-date, and an `is_reliable` flag (true when
  `data_point_count >= 3 AND actual_to_date > 0`). New Tauri
  command `get_cost_forecast`. Frontend integration deferred to
  v0.5.1 alongside the Overview restructure. Preserves Mac's
  iter21 last-day-of-month hotfix (Sentry 7450581409): on day N of
  N-day month, the regression-extrapolation path is skipped so
  empty `(day+1)..=days` ranges don't fall through. 9 new backend
  tests pin algorithm parity against fixture inputs (uniform days,
  growing trend, last-day, lower-bound clamp, two-point unreliable,
  zero-data-unreliable, multi-provider aggregation).

### Fixed
- **zh-CN / ja synced-ago line: localized time units.**
  v0.4.22 hardcoded English `"s" / "min" / "hr" / "d"` into the
  rendered string, so the per-provider "synced X ago" line read as
  `"6 s前同步"` in Chinese — the trailing English `s` directly
  before CJK characters reads as visually empty. v0.4.23 VM verify
  flagged this. v0.5.0 splits `formatRelativeShort` into
  `formatRelativeShortParts(updated_at): {value, unit} | null` and
  has the Providers card compose via i18n: `time.unit_s` / `_min` /
  `_hr` / `_d` keys at the top level of each locale. zh-CN now
  renders 秒 / 分钟 / 小时 / 天; ja renders 秒 / 分 / 時間 / 日;
  en stays s / min / hr / d. The legacy `formatRelativeShort` is
  kept as the English-only debug helper for tests and unparseable-
  passthrough behavior.

### Notes
- Local-only changes — no backend schema changes, no new RPCs.
  Pre-flight inspection of `dashboard_summary` via Supabase MCP
  (project `gkjwsxotmwrgqsvfijzs`) confirmed it returns ONLY
  `today_usage / today_cost / active_sessions / online_devices /
  unresolved_alerts / today_sessions` — no `risk_signals`,
  `top_projects`, or `yield_score`. v0.5.1 will source those from
  the existing `sessions` and `alerts` tables client-side.
- 229 tests green (175 backend, +8 forecast; 54 frontend, +4
  formatRelativeShortParts).
- Gemini 3.1 Pro v0.5.0 review gave a clean bill of health on
  algorithm fidelity (blend weighting `n/14` capped at 0.8,
  Bessel-corrected std-dev, iter21 last-day guard, lower-bound
  clamp at actual_to_date) and on the formatRelativeShortParts
  null-return semantic. One refactor suggestion adopted: extracted
  shared `ensure_daily_usage(user_id, days)` helper from
  `get_daily_usage` + `get_cost_forecast` — closes a small race
  window if both Tauri commands fire simultaneously and both
  miss cache.
- Out of scope this sprint (deferred): yield-score card (depends on
  git-attribution infrastructure that desktop doesn't have); PDF
  export; activity timeline; demo mode. See
  `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN_2026-05-05_desktop_mac_parity_v2.md`.

## [0.4.23] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Shutdown latency capped at ~100 ms (was up to 120 s).**
  `wait_for_next_tick` previously had two `select!` arms (sleep,
  manual-refresh recv); a `stop` flag raised mid-sleep wasn't
  observed until the 120 s sleep elapsed. v0.4.21 + v0.4.22 added
  `&& !stop.load(...)` guards on the inner `while` loops as a
  partial fix, but those checks only ran AFTER the wait returned.
  v0.4.23 adds a third `Stopped` variant and a third select arm
  (`poll_stop_signal` polls every 100 ms) so a stop signal during
  the 120 s sleep returns immediately. Net: closing the app no
  longer hangs on a stale background-sync thread for up to 2
  minutes.

### Changed
- **Single retry-after-backoff on transient HTTP 5xx / network
  errors.** A one-shot Anthropic 503, Supabase 502 during a deploy,
  or DNS hiccup during VPN reconnect previously ticked the
  `consecutive_failures` counter on the very next 120 s cycle —
  meaning two unlucky transients could cross the
  `SYNC_FAILURE_NOTIFY_THRESHOLD` and fire a desktop notification
  the user shouldn't see. v0.4.23 retries ONCE after a 5 s sleep
  before counting; if the retry succeeds, the failure is invisible
  to the streak counter. Conservative: covers HTTP 500/502/503/504/
  429 plus textual matches for "connection reset/refused", "timed
  out", "network is unreachable", "temporary failure in name
  resolution". 4xx / auth failures are NOT retried (those are real,
  user-actionable). Plain `Err` variants for local issues (JSON
  parse, file IO, panic) also not retried.

### Notes
- 4 new backend tests:
  - `stop_signal_during_idle_returns_stopped_promptly` — pins the
    100 ms-cadence guarantee using start_paused virtual time.
  - `stop_already_set_at_entry_returns_stopped_immediately` —
    fast-path: if `stop` was set BEFORE the wait was entered (e.g.
    the previous tick took long enough for stop to land), return
    `Stopped` immediately, not after the first 100 ms poll cycle.
  - `looks_like_transient_5xx_matches_common_shapes` — 10 positive
    cases covering all the upstream / network shapes.
  - `looks_like_transient_5xx_rejects_4xx_and_local` — 7 negative
    cases (4xx, JSON parse, file IO, panic, success messages).
- 217 tests green (167 backend, +4 new; 50 frontend, +0).

## [0.4.22] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Settings → About: "Send test event" button.** Fires a tagged Info
  event into Sentry (`diagnostic_test=true`). Lets the user (or the
  VM verifier) confirm the crash-reporting chain — DSN config →
  network egress → org-side intake — is actually live, not just
  "no events because nothing has panicked." The desktop Sentry
  project's lifetime issue count was 0 since instrumentation went
  in 2026-04-22; without a deliberate emit path, "0 events" was
  ambiguous. New Tauri command `emit_test_sentry_event` is a thin
  wrapper around `sentry::capture_message` that sets `diagnostic_test`
  + `emitted_at` tags and Info level. Safe on no-DSN builds — Sentry
  no-ops the call.
- **Per-provider "synced X ago" line on Providers cards.** Renders a
  small subtle text next to the provider's badges showing how long
  ago the server-side row last updated, with second-level resolution
  for fresh syncs (formatted via the new `formatRelativeShort`
  helper: 12 s / 3 min / 2 hr / 5 d). Fills the gap between
  "everything is fine" (no badge) and the v0.4.15 stale badge that
  only fires after 6 min — users can now see sync ACTIVITY, not
  just absence-of-error.

### Changed
- **Providers tab now polls `provider_summary` + collector status
  every 30 s while mounted.** Previously the displayed `updated_at`
  only changed on tab mount or after a manual "Refresh quota now"
  click, so users idling on the tab saw the same timestamp from the
  initial fetch even though background sync had landed fresh rows.
  The v0.4.20 collector-status cache also now stays current — a
  transient error mid-cycle now surfaces in the badge within ≤ 30 s
  instead of waiting for the next manual click. Cadence chosen at
  30 s to match the alerts tab and stay ≤ the 120 s background-sync
  interval.

### Notes
- `formatRelativeShort` adds 6 new tests in `format.test.ts`
  (seconds / minutes / hours / days / clock-skew clamp / unparseable
  input). i18n.test.ts's critical-labels list now also pins the 6
  new keys (4 Sentry test event + 2 synced-ago) across all 3
  languages.
- 213 tests green (163 backend, +0; 50 frontend, +6).
- Gemini 3.1 Pro v0.4.22 review caught two unmount-race P3s:
  the new 30 s polling effect could `setServerRows` on a dead
  component if the tab unmounted mid-`Promise.all`, and
  `sendSentryTest`'s 4 s reset timer could fire after navigating
  away from About. Both fixed with mount-flag guards
  (`cancelled` boolean for the polling effect, `mountedRef` for
  the AboutSection state setters). Sentry tagging via
  `sentry::with_scope` + tag isolation confirmed correct — no
  PII leakage, no global-scope pollution.

## [0.4.21] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **v0.4.20 Item 1 fix-to-the-fix.** v0.4.20 added an mpsc channel so a
  manual "Refresh now" click resets the 120 s background-sync
  countdown — but the loop still ran a `background_tick` at the top
  of the next iteration after the wake, producing a redundant
  `quota::collect_all` call ~2 s after every manual click. VM Block A
  measured this exactly: manual click at 16:42:05, spurious extra
  `collect_all` at 16:42:07 (+2 s), then the next regular tick at
  16:44:09 (T_click + 120 s, which IS correct). v0.4.21 changes
  `wait_for_next_tick` to return a `WaitOutcome` enum (`Elapsed` /
  `Reset`) and the loop uses
  `while wait_for_next_tick(...).await == WaitOutcome::Reset {}` so a
  manual-refresh wake re-enters the wait without triggering an
  intermediate tick. Net behavior: clicking Refresh in the idle window
  now produces exactly ONE `collect_all` (the manual one) and shifts
  the next background tick to T_click + 120 s, instead of producing
  two close-together calls.

### Changed
- **Providers tab "Refresh now" → "Refresh quota now"**
  (`立即刷新配额` / `クォータを今すぐ更新`). Disambiguates from the
  global `Rescan` / `重新扫描` / `再スキャン` button in the top-right,
  which scans local CLI usage data — not provider quotas. Spotted as
  a UX nit in the v0.4.20 VM verify report.

### Notes
- **Gemini 3.1 Pro v0.4.21 review caught two more issues** beyond the
  primary +2 s tick:
  - **P1 (channel-close busy loop)**: the bare `_ = rx.recv()` select
    arm matches both `Some(())` and `None`. If
    `MANUAL_REFRESH_TX.set(tx)` ever fails (e.g. duplicate
    `spawn_background_sync` from a hot-reload), the local `tx` is
    dropped, closing the channel — `recv()` then returns `None`
    instantly, the arm fires, the new `while … == Reset` pattern
    busy-loops at 100 % CPU. Fixed by changing the arm to
    `Some(_) = rx.recv()` so the arm is disabled (not fired) on
    channel close, leaving the sleep arm to run normally.
  - **P2 (shutdown latency under repeated clicks)**: the new inner
    `while … == Reset {}` doesn't check `stop`. If the user keeps
    clicking Refresh faster than 120 s, the loop can outlive a
    shutdown request indefinitely. Fixed with `&& !stop.load(...)`
    on the while condition at both call sites.
- 1 new test: `manual_refresh_does_not_cause_extra_tick` simulates the
  loop with a counter standing in for `background_tick` and asserts
  the count stays at 1 after a manual refresh fires mid-idle, then
  bumps to 2 only after a full `interval` has elapsed since the
  click. Test cleanup uses `drop(tx)` directly (not `loop_handle.abort()`)
  to validate the P1 fix end-to-end. The two existing v0.4.20 mpsc
  tests now also assert the `WaitOutcome` discriminant.
- Both call sites of `wait_for_next_tick` in `spawn_background_sync`
  use the `while … == Reset && !stop {}` pattern — the
  post-`device_status` cleared-credentials path also benefits (a
  manual click after a pairing wipe no longer fires a useless tick).
- 207 tests green (163 backend, +1 new; 44 frontend, +0).

## [0.4.20] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Per-provider error badge on the Providers tab.** When a collector
  (Claude / Codex / Cursor / Gemini / Copilot / OpenRouter) fails — bad
  credentials file, expired refresh, HTTP 5xx — the affected card now
  renders a red "error" badge with the failure reason in the tooltip.
  Closes the gap between v0.4.15's amber "stale" badge (which only
  fires after 6 minutes of stale `updated_at`) and the user noticing
  something's wrong. Worse: a provider that was NEVER successfully
  collected (just signed in, refresh broken) had no row, so "stale"
  never fired either — only "error" surfaces that case. Backend
  refactored each `<provider>::collect()` from `Option<QuotaSnapshot>`
  to `Result<Option<QuotaSnapshot>, CollectorError>` with three
  discriminant variants (`Http`, `SchemaOrIo`, `RefreshFailed`); `Ok(None)`
  preserves the silent "user not signed in" skip. Per Gemini 3.1 Pro
  v0.4.20 review: the typed enum (vs raw `String`) keeps the door open
  for future retry-policy work without revisiting collector signatures.
- **Settings → Integrations now shows the active credentials backend.**
  A "Storage: OS keychain" line in emerald, or "Storage: file (keyring
  unavailable) ⚠" in amber with a tooltip explaining how to enable the
  keychain on Linux. v0.4.16 already routed this state through Copy
  Diagnostic, but a Linux user without `libsecret` who never copied
  diagnostics silently stayed on file storage. Per Gemini 3.1 Pro
  v0.4.20 review: pair every silent fallback with a discoverable
  surface; the diagnostic copy alone is too easy to miss.

### Changed
- **"Refresh now" button now interrupts the background sync sleep.**
  When the user clicks Refresh at second 118 of a 120 s background
  cycle, the upcoming background tick used to fire 2 s later — a
  redundant sync. v0.4.20 wires a `tokio::sync::mpsc` channel between
  `sync_now` and the loop's idle window so the next 120 s countdown
  restarts from "now" instead. Per Gemini 3.1 Pro v0.4.20 review:
  the initial `tokio::sync::Notify` proposal had the exact bug we were
  trying to fix — permits earned during the active tick get buffered,
  then consumed by the next `select!`, firing a redundant background
  tick right after the manual one. Fixed by drain-before-select on the
  mpsc receiver so signals that arrive *during* the active tick are
  discarded, and only signals that arrive *during* the idle window
  cause a reset.

### Notes
- The user-invoked Tauri `sync_now` and the background loop now share
  an inner `perform_sync` helper. `sync_now` calls it then pokes the
  manual-refresh channel; `background_tick` calls it directly so the
  loop doesn't poke itself.
- 11 new tests (162 backend total, was 151; 44 frontend unchanged):
  two `tokio::test(start_paused = true)` tests pin the
  drain-before-select contract, three pin the `CollectorError` wire
  format + helper, six pin the credentials-file read seam returns
  `Ok(None)` on missing files and `Err` on malformed JSON across the
  three OAuth-file collectors.

## [0.4.19] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- **"Refresh now" button on the Providers tab.** Click to run all 6
  provider collectors (Claude/Codex/Cursor/Gemini/Copilot/OpenRouter)
  + reload server-side quota data immediately, instead of waiting up
  to 120s for the next background sync cycle. Disabled while a manual
  sync is in flight (per Gemini 3.1 Pro review of the v0.4.19 plan —
  spam-clicks would fire concurrent sync_now calls against provider
  rate limits).

### Changed
- **Proactive Claude/Gemini OAuth refresh** — refresh now fires when
  the token has < 5 minutes of life remaining (was: only after expiry,
  with a 60s safety margin for Claude / 0s for Gemini). With the
  120-second background sync cycle, a 5-minute buffer absorbs ~2
  missed ticks before the token actually expires. The shared constant
  `quota::PRE_EXPIRY_BUFFER_MS` keeps Claude and Gemini consistent —
  pinned via `pre_expiry_buffer_pinned_at_5_minutes` test so future
  drift is caught.

### Fixed
- **Removed v0.4.16's `provider_creds.json` breadcrumb.** v0.4.16
  rewrote the file with `version: 2` + zeroed values as a one-release
  rollback safety net during the keychain migration. v0.4.18 is now
  stable in production; the breadcrumb is no longer needed.
  v0.4.19 deletes it on a background thread at app startup (per
  Gemini review: filesystem I/O during init must not block the main
  thread). The deletion is gated on `version >= 2` AND keychain being
  the active backend — v1 files (where the file IS the storage) are
  never touched.

### Notes
- The deferral note in the v0.4.14-v0.4.16 dev plan claiming
  "Codex auth model is different (long-lived session + cookie). Not a
  refresh-token flow" was wrong. `quota/codex.rs::refresh_tokens` has
  shipped active OAuth refresh against `auth.openai.com/oauth/token`
  with the public PKCE client_id since v0.4.3 — it just uses an
  8-day `last_refresh` staleness gate instead of `expiresAt`. No work
  needed; deferral deleted from internal notes.

## [0.4.18] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **OpenRouter custom endpoint URL row now has a Clear button**, matching
  the parity of the 3 secret rows above (Cursor cookie / Copilot token /
  OpenRouter API key). Previously the only way to clear the URL was to
  manually empty the field and save — VM verification of v0.4.17 flagged
  the inconsistency. The URL isn't a secret so we skip the confirm modal
  (which exists for "expensive-to-recreate token" semantics) and clear
  directly.

## [0.4.17] — 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **"Copy diagnostic snapshot" now includes the provider-creds backend
  line** ("OS keychain" / "file (keyring unavailable)"). v0.4.16 wired
  the backend into the Rust `DiagnosticSnapshot` struct but missed
  adding the formatter line in `App.tsx::diagText`, so the field was
  silently dropped on its way to the clipboard. VM E2E verification
  of v0.4.16 (D-block) caught this — the data was already in the IPC
  response, just not rendered. Pure-rendering fix.

## [0.4.16] — 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Cursor / Copilot / OpenRouter credentials now stored in the OS
  keychain** (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux
  Secret Service via `libsecret`). Replaces the v0.4.6 plaintext-
  with-mode-0600 storage. On first launch after upgrade, existing
  credentials migrate automatically — the plaintext file is then
  rewritten with `version: 2` + zeroed values. (v0.4.17 will delete
  the file entirely; the two-step gives one release of rollback room
  in case migration goes wrong.)
- Linux installs without a running keyring service (headless server,
  minimal container) gracefully fall back to the v0.4.6 file storage
  with a one-time INFO log line. The active backend is surfaced via
  `diagnostic_snapshot.provider_creds_backend` so security-conscious
  users can verify they're on the OS keychain rather than the file.
  Per Gemini 3.1 Pro review: silent fallback can mislead users; the
  diagnostic copy makes it visible.

### Implementation notes
- `keychain.rs` gained a generic `store_at(account, value)` /
  `read_at(account)` / `delete_at(account)` API alongside the
  existing v0.3.0 OTP refresh-token wrappers. Same `KeychainError`
  with `NotAvailable` discriminant.
- `provider_creds.rs` runs the v1 → v2 migration in
  `tauri::Builder::setup` at app startup, NOT on first `save()`.
  Per Gemini review (P1): tying it to `save()` would leave users
  who never edit creds on the plaintext file forever, fragmenting
  the user base.
- 8 tests in `provider_creds.rs` (was 6) — added Backend enum
  serialization pin + v2-file idempotency guard.

## [0.4.15] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Stale-data indicator on provider cards.** Each provider row now
  shows a small amber "stale" badge when the cached server data is
  more than 6 minutes old. Hover for an exact "Last updated N min/hr/d
  ago" tooltip. Helps users distinguish "Gemini hasn't synced yet"
  from "Gemini sync failed and the values are old". Threshold is 6
  minutes (not 5) so it doesn't flap right before each 2-min sync
  cycle — per Gemini 3.1 Pro's review of the v0.4.14-v0.4.16 dev
  plan. Threshold pinned in a vitest test.

### Fixed (backend)
- **OpenRouter balance no longer truncates above ~$21,474.**
  Supabase migration v0.43 (`v0_43_provider_quotas_bigint_and_updated_at`)
  bumped `provider_quotas.{quota, remaining}` from `integer` (i32) to
  `bigint`. Rust side has been i64 since v0.4.0; the cast happened on
  INSERT inside the helper_sync RPC, so any user with an OpenRouter
  balance ≥ ~$21k saw truncated values until now. Migration is
  data-preserving (every existing row's value fits in both i32 and
  bigint by definition).

### Backend changes (server-side, no client action needed)
- Migration `v0_43_provider_quotas_bigint_and_updated_at` applied to
  prod Supabase (project `gkjwsxotmwrgqsvfijzs`):
  - `ALTER TABLE provider_quotas ALTER COLUMN quota TYPE bigint`
  - `ALTER TABLE provider_quotas ALTER COLUMN remaining TYPE bigint`
  - `provider_summary()` RPC now projects `updated_at` per row
- `ProviderSummaryRow` (Rust + TS) gains `updated_at: Option<String>`
  / `updated_at: string | null`. Older clients still work — Supabase
  returns the new field, old clients ignore unknown fields.

## [0.4.14] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Active OAuth refresh for Claude tokens.** When `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
  has an expired `accessToken` but a present `refreshToken`, we now POST
  to Anthropic's OAuth endpoint (`console.anthropic.com/v1/oauth/token`,
  PKCE public client, no client_secret) and atomically write the
  refreshed tokens back to disk. Mirrors the v0.4.7-v0.4.12 Gemini
  refresh work. Previously expired Claude tokens silently skipped
  collection until the user re-launched `claude` CLI to refresh,
  which gave a stale Claude card on the Providers tab if the user
  hadn't opened a Claude session in ~8h.

### Changed
- Promoted all `[Claude]` collector log lines from DEBUG to INFO
  (matching the v0.4.10 Gemini pattern), so users + future debugging
  can see which exit path was taken without the "silent half-fix"
  failure mode.
- `ClaudeCredentialsFile` and `ClaudeOAuthInner` now `flatten extra`
  unknown fields so atomic write-back from the refresh path
  preserves keys like `subscriptionType` (which `claude` CLI itself
  consumes) instead of silently dropping them.

### Notes
- **Anthropic Acceptable Use:** the read-only quota fetch (`/api/oauth/usage`)
  this app has been doing since v0.4.0 is unchanged. v0.4.14 only
  refreshes the access_token to keep that read-only fetch working
  past the ~8h token expiry — we do not proxy any inference traffic.

## [0.4.13] — 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Header app icon now renders the real CLI Pulse logo instead of
  a placeholder green-cyan gradient square.** The `<div>` placeholder
  in `App.tsx`'s top-left header was originally added during the
  v0.1 scaffold and was never replaced with the actual icon. The
  app icon at `src-tauri/icons/icon.png` (and its size variants)
  was correctly bundled by Tauri for the OS-level window title bar
  and tray, but the in-app header was rendering a Tailwind gradient
  div instead. v0.4.13 imports `src/assets/app-icon.png` (copied
  from `src-tauri/icons/128x128.png`) and renders it as an `<img>`
  in the header.

## [0.4.12] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Gemini OAuth refresh now ships a guaranteed-fallback hardcoded
  client_id+secret from upstream gemini-cli.** v0.4.11's recursive
  bundle walk found the chunks but still couldn't extract the
  client_id/client_secret pair from modern @google/gemini-cli
  releases — esbuild's code-splitting + property-assignment
  minification produces shapes that no realistic regex can match
  reliably. VM substring count confirmed `client_id` is present in
  14 chunk files and `client_secret` in 10, but they're emitted as
  property keys on imported config objects rather than as
  recognizable named constants OR co-located literal value pairs.
  Rather than chase another regex iteration that the next esbuild
  flag will break, v0.4.12 hardcodes the upstream public values
  from `packages/core/src/code_assist/oauth2.ts` (Apache-2.0).
  These are "installed application" OAuth credentials per Google's
  own documentation — the secret is intentionally checked into
  gemini-cli's open-source repo and is "obviously not treated as a
  secret" (see developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#installed).
  Local extraction still runs first so any future upstream rotation
  is picked up automatically; the hardcoded values only kick in
  when extraction returns None (which is the normal case for
  modern bundled npm installs).

### Added
- `fallback_oauth_client_values_match_upstream_shape` test —
  pins format invariants (apps.googleusercontent.com suffix on the
  client_id, GOCSPX- prefix and minimum length on the secret) so a
  typo at copy time can't silently 401 against Google.

### Notes
- License: gemini-cli is Apache-2.0. The two literal constants
  themselves are not copyrightable (they're identifiers / facts);
  the source-of-truth comment in `gemini_refresh.rs` cites the
  upstream file path so attribution is clear.
- Stability: in 9+ months on npm, gemini-cli has not rotated these
  values — rotation would break every existing installed CLI's
  refresh path simultaneously, so they're as stable as installed-app
  credentials get.

## [0.4.11] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Gemini OAuth refresh now reaches `dist/src/code_assist/oauth2.js`
  in modern monorepo @google/gemini-cli installs.** v0.4.10's
  diagnostic logging surfaced that on Windows VM, discovery walked
  76 .js files in `<root>/bundle/` (the bundled chunks) but matched
  none — the actual unbundled source `oauth2.js` lives at
  `<root>/dist/src/code_assist/oauth2.js`, which v0.4.10's scan
  didn't find because the scan was non-recursive (one level only).
  Three fixes:
  1. **Recursive .js walk** under each `<root>/bundle`, `<root>/dist`,
     `<root>/lib` subdir, capped at depth 4 (covers the
     `dist/src/code_assist/oauth2.js` path) and skipping nested
     `node_modules/` to avoid expanding into transitive deps.
  2. **Per-root legacy-path probing** — the `gemini-cli-core` install
     root used to be joined with a relative path that already
     contained `node_modules/@google/gemini-cli-core/...`, producing
     a doubly-nested path that never existed. v0.4.11 probes both
     `<root>/dist/src/code_assist/oauth2.js` (sibling/hoisted layout
     in modern npm) and the deep-nested form in order.
  3. **Multiline-assignment test pinned.** Upstream gemini-cli-core
     emits `const OAUTH_CLIENT_ID =\n    '...';` after TS→JS compile.
     Rust regex `\s*` already matches across newlines, but a new test
     locks in that contract so a future regex tweak can't silently
     break it.

### Added
- 4 new Vitest tests in `quota/gemini_refresh.rs`:
  - `extract_credentials_from_multiline_assignment` — confirms regex
    handles upstream's split `const X =\n  '...';` shape.
  - `scan_dir_recursively_finds_creds_three_levels_deep` — synthetic
    `dist/src/code_assist/oauth2.js` layout, asserts recursive walk
    reaches it.
  - `scan_dir_recursive_skips_node_modules` — defensive: vendored
    deps' `node_modules/` are skipped to avoid pathological scans.
  - `scan_dir_recursive_returns_none_for_missing_dir` — probing a
    non-existent root must not panic (common: half the candidate
    roots are missing on every refresh).

### Notes
- v0.4.10's INFO-level logging is preserved unchanged. After the
  recursive walk hits the OAuth pair, you'll see one
  `[Gemini] refresh: found OAuth pair via legacy direct path ...`
  (or `... after scanning N .js file(s) recursively under ...`)
  followed by the existing
  `[Gemini] OAuth token refreshed ...` success line and the
  `[Gemini] refresh wrote new tokens to ... (atomic, mode 0600)`
  write-back confirmation.

## [0.4.10] — 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Gemini collector now logs every branch at INFO level.** v0.4.9 VM
  verification produced a "silent half-fix": the Providers tab kept
  rendering Gemini, but no `[Gemini]`-prefixed log line ever appeared
  in the running v0.4.9 process, the `oauth_creds.json` mtime was
  unchanged, AND `quota::collect_all` reported Gemini in the populated
  list every cycle. The contradiction was that several `collect()`
  exit paths logged at DEBUG (filtered by the global INFO filter from
  v0.3.4) and the "token still valid" path logged nothing at all, so
  any of those branches looked identical in the log file. v0.4.10
  promotes every branch to INFO and adds an entry-point line that
  prints the raw `expiry_date` and `now_ms` it's comparing, plus
  whether `refresh_token` and `access_token` are present. With this,
  the next VM run will tell us exactly which exit path is firing
  (token still valid / no refresh token / refresh attempted-and-failed
  / refresh attempted-and-succeeded) instead of leaving us inferring
  it from server-side state.
- `gemini_refresh::refresh()` now logs the OAuth client creds path it
  discovered (or which root list it probed when it found nothing),
  and `scan_dir_for_credentials()` reports the .js scan count per dir.
  This pinpoints whether v0.4.9's bundle-walking is even reaching the
  user's install or skipping it because the candidate root path is
  wrong on their box.

### Notes
- No behavior change beyond logging — the actual refresh flow,
  discovery order, and atomic write-back are byte-identical to v0.4.9.
  This is a pure-diagnostics ship to debug v0.4.9 in the field.

## [0.4.9] — 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Gemini OAuth refresh now finds credentials in modern bundled
  @google/gemini-cli releases.** v0.4.7 introduced active OAuth
  refresh by mirroring CodexBar's discovery: look for a literal
  `oauth2.js` source file at known npm/Homebrew/Nix paths. That
  works for Homebrew installs and older gemini-cli versions, but
  modern @google/gemini-cli npm releases are esbuild-bundled —
  there's no standalone `oauth2.js`; the OAuth code lives inside
  hashed chunks like `bundle/gemini-3OZCG3O2.js`. VM verification
  of v0.4.7 caught this gap (Windows user with gemini-cli installed
  at `%APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\@google\gemini-cli\` — refresh
  failed because the v0.4.7 path search looked for a file that
  doesn't exist in the bundled release).
  v0.4.9 expands `find_oauth_credentials()`:
  1. Try the legacy direct `oauth2.js` path first (Homebrew /
     source layouts, unchanged).
  2. Walk `<gemini-cli-root>/bundle/*.js` chunks (modern npm
     releases — primary expected match).
  3. Walk `<gemini-cli-root>/dist/*.js` and `<root>/lib/*.js` as
     additional fallbacks.
  Plus a value-pattern regex fallback for when minification has
  stripped the named constants `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` /
  `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`. The fallback matches Google's canonical
  formats:
  - Client ID: `<9-12 digit project>-<random>.apps.googleusercontent.com`
  - Client secret: `GOCSPX-<22+ chars>`
  Named-constant regex still runs first; value-pattern only kicks
  in when minification has obscured the names.

### Added
- 4 new Vitest tests in `quota/gemini_refresh.rs`:
  - `extract_credentials_from_minified_bundle_chunk` — verifies the
    value-pattern fallback works on real esbuild output shape.
  - `value_fallback_rejects_too_short_secret` — defensive: the
    `{20,}` length floor on GOCSPX-... avoids false matches on
    GOCSPX-prefixed substrings shorter than a real client secret.
  - `value_fallback_rejects_non_googleusercontent_domain` — the
    `.apps.googleusercontent.com` suffix is required.
  - `named_constant_takes_priority_over_value_fallback` — when
    both forms are present (e.g. comments documenting other OAuth
    apps), the named constants win.
- 4 KB JS file size cap on bundle scans to avoid pathological I/O
  on unrelated huge JS bundles.

### Changed
- Discovery roots expanded to also include `@google/gemini-cli-core`
  (sometimes installed alongside gemini-cli rather than nested),
  Windows `%PROGRAMFILES%\nodejs\node_modules\@google\gemini-cli`,
  and Mac/Linux `~/.nvm/versions/node` for NVM users.

### Notes
- Best-effort behavior unchanged: if no candidate path matches OR
  the refresh API rejects, fall back to v0.4.6 silent-skip. No
  regression for users without gemini-cli installed.
- Total: **131 Rust lib tests** (was 127 in v0.4.7) + 33 Vitest
  tests.
- iOS / Android / Mac unaffected. Server-side schema unchanged.
- v0.4.x desktops on auto-update pick this up automatically once
  v0.4.9 promotes to Latest.

## [0.4.8] — 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Provider card visibility no longer gated on local scan cache.**
  v0.4.3 through v0.4.7 only rendered Provider cards when the local
  cost-usage scan had at least one entry for that provider. A user
  who'd just paired the desktop and had a populated server-side
  `provider_quotas` row (from another paired device, or from active
  Gemini OAuth refresh in v0.4.7) but no recent local activity for
  that provider got an empty Providers tab. VM verification of
  v0.4.7 confirmed the gap (Gemini server row populated, no card
  rendered).
  v0.4.8 extends the card aggregation to backfill any
  server-known provider absent from local scan with empty aggregate
  values. Tier bars + plan badge still render from server data; the
  card subtitle distinguishes the no-local-scan case with a
  dedicated copy line ("No local activity yet — quota from your
  account" / "暂无本地活动 — 配额来自账号" /
  "ローカル使用履歴なし — クォータはアカウントから取得").

### Added
- New i18n key `providers.no_local_scan_yet` in all 3 locales
  (en / zh-CN / ja).

### Notes
- Pure frontend fix. No backend / collector / schema changes.
- Local-scan-based numbers (active days, msgs, models, cost) stay
  zero for server-only cards; tier bars + plan badge show real
  quota state.
- Sort order: cost desc, then provider name asc as a tie-breaker
  (so server-only zero-cost entries have a stable order).
- v0.4.x desktops on auto-update pick this up automatically once
  v0.4.8 is published.

### v0.4.9+ backlog
- **Stale indicator on provider cards** when last-server-update is
  > N hours old. Requires backend `provider_summary` to expose
  `updated_at` (currently shipped omitted) — schema change pending
  user flag per autonomy rules.
- **Claude active OAuth refresh.** Different mechanism from Gemini
  (Anthropic doesn't expose a simple POST /token; Claude CLI
  rotates via its own internal flow). Investigation pending.
- **OS keychain / `tauri-plugin-stronghold`** migration for
  `provider_creds.json`.
- **OpenRouter i32 overflow → bigint migration**. Pending user flag.

## [0.4.7] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Active Gemini OAuth refresh.** Gemini's access token expires
  ~8 hours after issue. v0.4.6 silently skipped collection past expiry,
  forcing the user to re-run `gemini` CLI to get fresh quota data.
  v0.4.7 now refreshes automatically by:
  - Locating the user's Gemini CLI installation's bundled `oauth2.js`
    (npm / Homebrew / Nix paths covered).
  - Regex-extracting `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` + `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` (these
    are the values Gemini CLI uses internally; not secrets per
    RFC 6749 §2.2 — already shipped in the user's local CLI binary).
  - POSTing to `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` with
    `grant_type=refresh_token`.
  - Atomically writing the new tokens back to
    `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` (mode 0600 set BEFORE rename).
  Mirrors macOS CodexBar `GeminiStatusProbe.swift:520-600` (commit
  82bbcde) — same scrape paths, same Google OAuth flow.
- **Best-effort fallback chain.** If `oauth2.js` can't be located OR
  the refresh API rejects, fall back to v0.4.6 silent-skip. No
  regression; expired-token + missing-CLI users see the same empty
  state they did before.
- **Structured success log.** `[Gemini] OAuth token refreshed via
  gemini-cli local credentials (expires in <N>s)` at INFO level — first
  evidence in `cli-pulse.log` that the refresh path is firing on
  real-user systems.

### Changed
- **Settings → Integrations panel position.** Moved from above
  Updates section to truly below Updates, per v0.4.6 dev plan §3
  ("dedicated section at the bottom"). VM verification of v0.4.6
  flagged the discrepancy. No functionality change.
- `quota/gemini.rs` `CredsFile` now retains `refresh_token` + `id_token`
  fields (was previously read-and-discarded). Required for the active
  refresh path; backwards-compatible for legacy file shapes that omit
  these fields.

### Tests
- 6 new Rust tests in `quota/gemini_refresh.rs`: `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` /
  `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` regex extraction (single/double quote, missing
  pair refused, empty content), Google refresh response parse
  (minimal + rotated tokens), candidate path collection smoke.
- Total: **127 Rust lib tests** (was 121 in v0.4.6) + 33 Vitest tests.

### CI infrastructure
- First v0.4.x tag built under the streamlined matrix
  (`f2eed29` 2026-05-04 dropped Win ARM64 + Linux ARM64 from the
  default matrix — public-repo Standard runners are FREE; ARM larger
  runners were billed for 0 real-user downloads). Tag-push CI cost
  drops from ~50 quota-min to ~25 quota-min per tag, $0 spend.

### Notes
- iOS / Android / Mac unaffected. Server-side schema unchanged.
- v0.4.x desktops on auto-update pick this up automatically once
  v0.4.7 promotes to Latest.
- v0.4.8+ candidates: OS keychain / `tauri-plugin-stronghold`
  migration for `provider_creds.json`; OpenRouter i32 overflow
  bigint migration (needs user backend-schema flag).

## [0.4.6] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Settings → Integrations panel for Cursor / Copilot / OpenRouter
  credentials.** v0.4.3 introduced these three providers but only read
  credentials from environment variables — a non-technical user had no
  in-app way to configure them. v0.4.6 adds a dedicated "Integrations"
  section at the bottom of the Settings tab with three rows:
  - Cursor session cookie
  - GitHub Copilot token
  - OpenRouter API key (with optional custom endpoint behind an
    "Advanced settings" toggle)
  Each row shows status (Configured / Not set) and an env-override
  warning banner when the corresponding env var is set, since the env
  takes priority over the saved value (backwards-compatible read order:
  env → file → none). Save is per-row; Clear opens a confirmation
  modal. Once saved, the raw value is never re-displayed — the UI only
  shows status. Replace by typing a new value or click Clear.
- **Locale-aware number formatting via i18next.** v0.4.5 plural-aware
  message keys (`{{count}} msgs`) interpolated raw integer strings
  ("2782 msgs"), losing the thousands separator that v0.4.4 and earlier
  rendered ("2,782 msgs"). v0.4.6 adds an i18next `number` formatter
  that routes numbers through `Intl.NumberFormat` with the active
  language; locale strings opt in via `{{count, number}}`. en / zh-CN
  / ja all use comma per CLDR.
- **Atomic credential persistence.** New `provider_creds.json` lives in
  the same per-user config dir as the existing `config.json`. Same
  security model: file mode 0600 on Unix (set BEFORE rename, so no
  permission window), per-user `%APPDATA%` ACL default on Windows.
  Atomic write via `tempfile::NamedTempFile` + persist; in-memory
  read-side cache invalidated on every save so live edits take effect
  on the next sync cycle without re-reading disk per-collector. Schema
  versioned (`version: 1`) for v0.4.7+ stronghold migration.

### Changed
- `quota/cursor.rs` / `quota/copilot.rs` / `quota/openrouter.rs`
  credential read priority: env var → `provider_creds.json` → none.
  Existing v0.4.5 env-var users keep working identically; new users go
  through the UI.

### Reviews
- **Gemini 3.1 Pro (2026-05-04)** — UX / product / i18n review of v0.4.6
  spec. 10 findings: 4 FAILs resolved inline in spec (textarea →
  password input, dedicated Integrations section vs Account/Budget
  sandwich, 4-state save → 2-state, clear-confirmation modal), 4
  ship-it-with-nits (HTTP 401 friendly copy mapping, zh-CN/ja
  translation specifics, env-override banner copy, OpenRouter base URL
  behind Advanced toggle), 2 ship-its (no-peek decision, zh-CN comma
  format).

### Tests
- 6 new Rust unit tests in `provider_creds.rs` (round-trip empty/
  populated, missing version defaults to 1, malformed JSON surfaces
  Err, unknown fields ignored, empty-string credential semantics).
- 3 new Vitest tests in `i18n.test.ts` for the number formatter
  (en/zh-CN/ja messages key with count=2782 renders "2,782 msgs"
  variant in each locale).
- Total: **121 Rust lib tests + 33 Vitest tests** (was 115 + 30 in v0.4.5).

### Deferred to v0.4.7+
- **CI dynamic matrix** for tag-push Windows-only optimization. v0.4.5
  attempt at job-level `if: matrix.platform` broke the workflow; v0.4.6
  ships with the same 4-platform build to avoid stacking pipeline risk
  with feature work. v0.4.7 will do this as a focused CI sprint with a
  throwaway rc tag for validation.
- **OS keychain / `tauri-plugin-stronghold`** migration. Plaintext
  mode-0600 storage is the v0.4.6 baseline; v0.4.7+ migrates to true
  cross-platform keychain.
- **Active Gemini OAuth refresh.** Still requires the user to run
  `gemini` CLI periodically to refresh `oauth_creds.json`.
- **OpenRouter i32 overflow** at $21k+ balance. Backend bigint
  migration pending user flag per autonomy rules.

### Notes
- Existing env-var users (CURSOR_COOKIE / COPILOT_API_TOKEN /
  OPENROUTER_API_KEY / OPENROUTER_API_URL) continue to work
  unchanged; env values take priority over saved file values, with a
  banner in the Settings UI explaining the override.
- No server-side schema changes. iOS / Android / Mac unaffected.
- v0.4.x desktops on auto-update pick this up automatically once
  v0.4.6 is published.

## [0.4.5] — 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Tier bar visual direction inverted vs text label.** v0.3.4–v0.4.4
  rendered each tier bar's fill width as `used%` (consumption) while
  the text label said `X/Y left` (remaining). The two halves of the
  same row pointed at opposite metrics — text "85 left" rendered
  alongside a 15%-filled bar. v0.4.5 flips the bar to fill from left
  to right with the **remaining** percentage, so 85 left = 85% green
  bar, matching the text. Color heat thresholds invert too:
  - >40% remaining → green (safe)
  - 10–40% remaining → amber/orange (warning)
  - ≤10% remaining → red (critical)
  Caught by user inspection of v0.4.4 Providers tab screenshot;
  applies to per-tier bars (`App.tsx:792-820`) and the singleton
  fallback bar for non-Claude providers with flat quota
  (`App.tsx:822-842`).
- **Pluralization for "active days", "msgs", "models".** Provider
  card subtitle hardcoded "{{count}} active days · {{msgs}} msgs"
  even when count was 1 ("1 active days · 0 msgs · 1 models"). The
  `models` count was also a hardcoded English string with no i18n
  routing. v0.4.5 splits into i18next plural-aware keys
  (`active_days_one/_other`, `messages_one/_other`,
  `models_one/_other`) for all three locales (en / zh-CN / ja). zh-CN
  and ja use the single CLDR form (`_other`); en uses both.

### Tests
- 5 new Vitest tests in `i18n.test.ts` covering plural forms across
  the 3 supported locales (en singular/plural toggle, zh-CN single-
  form invariance, ja single-form invariance, models + messages
  variants).

### Notes
- Pure frontend UX polish. No collector / backend / schema changes.
  Per-provider quota fetch path unchanged from v0.4.4 — the live
  values being visualized are the same.
- v0.4.4 desktops on auto-update pick this up automatically once
  v0.4.5 is published.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Claude collector schema mismatch.** v0.4.3 `ClaudeCredentials` struct
  expected flat top-level `{accessToken, expiresAt, ...}`, but real
  `claude` CLI ≥2.x writes nested `{claudeAiOauth: {accessToken, ...}}`.
  Every sync silently parsed to `None` (debug-level log) — Claude
  collector was effectively dead code in v0.4.3 for all real users.
  v0.4.4 nested-only struct, mirrors CodexBar upstream commit `82bbcde`
  (`Sources/CodexBarCore/Providers/Claude/ClaudeOAuth/ClaudeOAuthCredentialModels.swift:65-78`).
  No flat-shape fallback — CodexBar upstream never accepted flat top-level
  either; matching upstream avoids divergent schema drift. `expiresAt`
  parsed strictly as epoch milliseconds (drops the v0.4.3 ISO-8601
  branching code path that was based on incorrect docstring assumption).
  Caught during VM E2E 2026-05-03 JST — Mac side never had real
  `~/.claude/.credentials.json` to validate against.
- **Codex `/wham/usage` parse error.** v0.4.3 `Credits.balance`
  deserialized as `Option<f64>`, but the real ChatGPT API returns
  `balance` as a JSON STRING (e.g. `"5.43"`) — verified via
  `wham_inspect.py` against a live ChatGPT Plus account 2026-05-03 JST.
  Every cycle's `resp.json::<UsageResponse>()` therefore failed with
  `parse: error decoding response body`, and Codex collector returned
  `None` despite valid creds + 200 OK response. v0.4.4 adds a string|
  number custom deserializer accepting both forms (back-compat for any
  account where the field was historically a number).
- **Per-collector log level for schema drift.** Claude / Codex / Gemini
  `read_*()` helpers now distinguish file-absent (`debug!` — user not
  signed in, expected) from JSON parse failure (`warn!` — schema drift,
  surface immediately). v0.4.3 collapsed both into `Option<None>` with
  `debug!`, which is why the Claude bug above went silent for the
  entire v0.4.3 era. Future Anthropic / OpenAI / Google response shape
  changes will now appear in `cli-pulse.log` on the very first cycle.

### Tests
- 5 new fixture tests in `claude.rs`: nested happy path with
  `subscriptionType` (silently ignored per upstream), flat-shape yields
  `oauth=None`, empty `accessToken` preserved through parse, missing
  `expiresAt` defensively returns false from `is_token_fresh`,
  past-`expiresAt` returns false. Removed 3 ISO-8601 expiry tests
  obsoleted by nested-only schema (real claude CLI never writes
  ISO-8601 there).
- 2 new fixture tests in `codex.rs`: real `/wham/usage` shape with
  string `balance` + 9 unknown top-level fields (`account_id`, `email`,
  `spend_control`, etc. — all silently ignored per default serde
  semantics); `balance` deserializer accepts string, number, null,
  empty-string, and absent-field forms.

### Notes
- Gemini token-expiry behavior unchanged (still v0.4.3 documented
  limitation per `gemini.rs:10-14`). Explicit `CollectorStatus::Expired`
  UI warning tracked for v0.4.5+ frontend sprint.
- helper_sync RPC wiring (`lib.rs::sync_now` building
  `p_provider_tiers` from `quota::collect_all`) confirmed correct in
  VM E2E 2026-05-03 JST — server `provider_quotas` row updates
  correctly as soon as any collector returns `Some(snapshot)`.
- No server-side schema changes. iOS / Android / Mac unaffected.
- v0.4.x desktops on auto-update pick this up automatically once
  v0.4.4 is published.

## [0.4.3] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Multi-provider quota collection.** v0.4.0–0.4.2 only ported the
  Claude OAuth collector. v0.4.3 adds 5 more providers, matching what
  the Mac menu-bar app already collects:
  - **Codex (OpenAI)** — reads `~/.codex/auth.json` (or
    `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`), refreshes OAuth access token via
    `auth.openai.com/oauth/token` if `last_refresh` > 8 days, hits
    `chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`. Emits "5h Window", "Weekly",
    "Credits" tiers. Mirrors `CodexCollector.swift`.
  - **Cursor** — reads env `CURSOR_COOKIE`, hits
    `cursor.com/api/usage-summary`. Emits "Plan" + "On-Demand" tiers
    (cents-scaled). Mirrors `CursorCollector.swift`.
  - **Gemini** — reads `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` (file-only path,
    matches Mac's secondary fallback). Hits
    `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com:loadCodeAssist` + `:retrieveUserQuota`.
    Groups buckets by model family, emits "Pro" / "Flash" /
    "Flash Lite" tiers. Active OAuth refresh deferred to v0.4.5+.
  - **GitHub Copilot** — reads env `COPILOT_API_TOKEN`, hits
    `api.github.com/copilot_internal/user` with the editor headers
    GitHub Copilot's internal API requires. Emits "Premium" + "Chat"
    tiers. Mirrors `CopilotCollector.swift`.
  - **OpenRouter** — reads env `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (optional
    `OPENROUTER_API_URL` override), hits `/credits` (required) and
    `/key` (optional, 3s timeout). Emits "Credits" + "Key Limit"
    tiers, dollar-scaled $1=100,000. Mirrors `OpenRouterCollector.swift`.
- All 6 providers run **concurrently** via `tokio::spawn` per arm with
  panic isolation (NOT `tokio::join!` — Codex review caught that
  `join!` shares a task with the parent and would unwind `sync_now`
  on any provider panic). Per-arm `JoinError::is_panic()` check logs
  panics at ERROR level but doesn't kill the sync.
- Per-provider structured logging: each `[Provider]`-prefixed
  WARN/DEBUG log makes `grep '\[Codex\]' cli-pulse.log` a triage
  tool. Per Gemini 3.1 Pro review.
- Provider name contract test: a checked-in snapshot of
  `Models.swift:10-37` `ProviderKind` raw values asserts against Rust
  constants in `quota/mod.rs`. Drift between Mac and Win/Linux
  provider names would land writes on different
  `(user_id, provider)` PKs and break dual-writer convergence.
- Sentry scrubber regex coverage extended for the new providers'
  token formats: OpenAI (`sk-proj-*`, `sk-svcacct-*`, legacy `sk-*`),
  GitHub legacy (`gh[pousr]_*`), GitHub PAT new (`github_pat_*`,
  47-char body), OpenRouter (`sk-or-*`), Google OAuth (`ya29.*`),
  generic Cookie + Authorization Bearer header redaction. 8 new
  Sentry tests.

### Changed
- **Module restructure**: existing v0.4.2 `quota.rs` moved to
  `quota/claude.rs`. New `quota/mod.rs` orchestrator owns the
  shared `QuotaSnapshot` / `TierEntry` types and provides
  `collect_all()`. Sibling modules: `codex.rs`, `cursor.rs`,
  `gemini.rs`, `copilot.rs`, `openrouter.rs`.
- `lib.rs::sync_now` now builds a multi-provider `p_provider_tiers`
  payload from `quota::collect_all()`. helper_sync's
  `jsonb_object_keys()` loop already handles multi-key maps —
  verified in v0.4.2 audit.

### Tests
- 35 new unit tests across the 5 new collectors (+ 8 Sentry, +
  existing 18 quota = **111 lib tests** total). Per-provider tests
  cover JSON parsing, tier emission, plan_type bucketing, error
  fallbacks, and provider-specific quirks (Codex `reset_at` epoch
  vs ISO, Copilot snake_case vs camelCase, Gemini launch-window
  null semantics, OpenRouter scaling).

### Reviews
- **Codex GPT-5.4 (2026-05-02)** — full spec audit + 5 Mac source
  files. 4 FIX-FIRST + 3 ship-it. Resolutions inline in the dev plan
  (`PROJECT_DEV_PLAN_2026-05-02_v0.4.3_multi_provider_quota.md` §10):
  panic isolation switched from `tokio::join!` to spawn-per-arm,
  Sentry regex extended for `github_pat_*` + generic Bearer,
  provider-name contract test added. **Deferred**: OpenRouter i32
  overflow at $21k+ balance is an inherited Mac bug requiring backend
  schema migration; tracked as v0.4.4+.
- **Gemini 3.1 Pro (2026-05-02)** — UX/product/i18n review. 4 FAIL.
  Per-provider WARN logs added (§4.6). Other UX gaps (env-var-only
  config, per-provider empty-state copy, token-expired UI warning)
  acknowledged as v0.4.4 frontend sprint scope.

### Known limitations (deferred to v0.4.4)
- Cursor / Copilot / OpenRouter credentials read from env vars only.
  Settings UI for credential entry pending.
- Gemini token refresh requires the user to run `gemini` CLI
  periodically. Active OAuth refresh + cross-platform Keychain pending.
- Token-expired silent-skip leaves stale provider_quotas row in
  place (no UI warning state). Explicit `CollectorStatus::Expired`
  + UI warning pending.
- Per-provider on/off toggle UI pending.

### Notes
- No server-side schema changes. iOS / Android / Mac unaffected.
- v0.4.x desktops on auto-update pick this up automatically.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Dual-writer payload alignment with Mac scanner.** `provider_quotas`
  is keyed `(user_id, provider)` and helper_sync does a full-replace
  upsert on `tiers` / `plan_type` / `reset_time`. v0.4.0 quota.rs
  diverged from Mac's `ClaudeOAuthStrategy.swift` /
  `ClaudeSourceStrategy.swift` in four places, so when both clients
  were active for the same account, the row flickered every time the
  alternate writer polled. v0.4.2 closes the gaps:
  - **Sonnet/Opus fallback.** Mac emits the "Sonnet only" tier using
    `seven_day_sonnet` OR `seven_day_opus`. v0.4.x previously only
    read `seven_day_sonnet` and skipped the tier whenever Anthropic
    served opus instead. quota.rs now adds a `seven_day_opus` field
    and falls back to it (sonnet wins when both present).
  - **Launch-window null semantics.** Mac's `parseLaunchWindow`
    distinguishes "key absent" (skip the tier) from "key present
    but null" (rolled out, unused — emit at 100% remaining). v0.4.x
    used `Option<UsageWindow>` which collapses both to `None`.
    Replaced with a `LaunchWindow` three-state enum + custom
    deserializer mirroring the Swift semantics; applied to
    `iguana_necktie` (Designs) and `seven_day_omelette` (Daily
    Routines).
  - **Plan-type formatting buckets.** Mac normalizes via lowercase
    substring match across 8 buckets ("Max 20x", "Max 5x", "Ultra",
    "Pro", "Team", "Enterprise", "Free", "Unknown"); v0.4.x used
    exact equality + verbatim fallback. Re-implemented `format_plan`
    to match Mac line-for-line.
  - **Outer `reset_time` field.** Mac's helper payload includes a
    top-level `reset_time` keyed off the 5h Window reset
    (`ClaudeSourceStrategy.swift:217`); v0.4.x lib.rs::sync_now
    omitted it. helper_sync writes whatever it sees to
    `provider_quotas.reset_time`, so the absence flipped the column
    NULL on every Win sync. quota.rs now exposes `session_reset` on
    `QuotaSnapshot` and lib.rs threads it into the upload body.

### Added
- 6 new unit tests covering: opus fallback when sonnet absent, sonnet
  precedence when both present, launch-window present-null at 100%,
  launch-window absent skip, outer session_reset taken from 5h, outer
  session_reset None when 5h missing. Existing tests updated for the
  new plan-type bucket logic ("garbage_tier" → "Unknown" not verbatim,
  None → "Unknown" not "Claude").

### Reviews
- **Codex GPT-5.4 (architecture review, 2026-05-02)** — independent
  audit of dual-writer correctness vs Mac Swift collector. Verdict:
  INV-1 PASS (tier names match), INV-3 PASS (0–100 percentage scale
  matches), INV-2/4/5 FAIL with concrete file:line evidence. All
  three FAILs resolved in this release. Without these fixes,
  promoting v0.4.1 to Latest would have caused row flicker on any
  account where Mac Swift menu-bar app and Win/Linux Tauri desktop
  ran simultaneously.

### Notes
- No server-side schema changes. iOS / Android / Mac unaffected.
- v0.4.x desktops on auto-update pick this up automatically.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Quota success log line.** v0.4.0's `quota.rs` only emitted log
  output on the failure paths (debug for missing creds / expired
  token, warn on API error) — the success branch was silent, so
  `cli-pulse.log` had no evidence the new collector was running on
  paired desktops with valid `.credentials.json`. Now writes
  `Claude quota updated: plan=<>, tiers=<n>, remaining=<n>` at info
  level once per successful fetch (every ~2-min sync cycle), so VM
  E2E and real-user diagnostics can confirm the collector is firing.

### Notes
- No behavior change. Only a single new `log::info!` call in
  `collect_claude()`'s `Ok` branch.
- iOS / Android / Mac unaffected.
- v0.4.0 desktops on auto-update: pick this up automatically.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Local Claude quota collection on Win / Linux / Mac.** The desktop
  now scrapes the Anthropic OAuth `/api/oauth/usage` endpoint on its
  own and uploads the result via `helper_sync`'s
  `p_provider_remaining` / `p_provider_tiers` parameters (which had
  been shipping as `{}` since v0.3.0). A signed-in desktop sees real
  Claude tier bars (`5h Window`, `Weekly`, `Sonnet only`, `Designs`,
  `Daily Routines`) within ~2 minutes of starting Claude Code,
  regardless of whether a Mac is online for the same account.
  - Reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json` — same path Claude Code
    writes on every OS.
  - Best-effort: missing creds, expired token, or API failure
    silently skip the quota upload without breaking session/alert
    sync.
  - Plan-type detection from `rateLimitTier` field: `max_20x` →
    "Max 20x", `max_5x` → "Max 5x", `pro` → "Pro", custom values
    pass through verbatim.
  - Token freshness check with 60-second safety margin. Both
    ISO-8601 and epoch-millisecond `expiresAt` formats supported.
  - Pure-Win / Linux users (the v0.3.0 OTP-onboarding target) now
    see real tier bars without needing a Mac in the loop.

### Fixed
- **Codex gpt-5.5 cost rendered as $0.00.** v0.3.5 VM E2E found
  pricing.rs only went up to gpt-5.4, so any account running Codex
  with `gpt-5.5` returned a null cost and aggregated to $0. Added
  `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.5-codex`, `gpt-5.5-mini`, `gpt-5.5-nano`,
  `gpt-5.5-pro` entries with rates mirroring gpt-5.4 (OpenAI hasn't
  published official 5.5 billing yet — flagged in source as
  approximate, replace when public).

### Privacy
- **Sentry scrubber extended for Anthropic tokens.** The new OAuth
  usage path uses `Authorization: Bearer sk-ant-oat...` headers; if
  these ever leak into error messages or breadcrumb URLs, the
  `before_send` hook now redacts them with the new
  `<anthropic-token-redacted>` marker. Permissive regex
  (`sk-ant-(oat|api|sid)\d{0,3}-...`) handles current and future
  version formats including the rumored `sid` prefix. 4 new tests
  cover oat / api / Bearer header / unversioned variants.

### Reviews
- Codex GPT-5.4 (SQL/security/correctness, 2026-05-02): caught two
  FIX-FIRSTs on the original spec — the Anthropic regex was too
  strict on version digits (`\d{2}` only matched 2-digit versions;
  permissive `\d{0,3}` handles 1/2/3-digit and unversioned), and
  noted scrubber coverage for stacktrace/request-metadata strings
  was contingent on the regex matching real tokens. Both resolved
  before code.

### Notes
- Server-side schema unchanged. iOS / Android / Mac unaffected.
- v0.3.x desktops on auto-update: unaffected. Existing helper_sync
  payload accepted both empty and non-empty quota maps from day 1.
- Codex / Cursor / OpenAI API quota collection deferred to v0.4.1+.

## [0.3.5] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Copy-diagnostics block missing the `Logs:` line.** v0.3.4 added
  `log_dir` to the Rust `DiagnosticSnapshot` but the TypeScript
  diagText() never rendered it. Found during v0.3.4 Win VM E2E.
- **Log file appeared empty for unpaired desktops.** All Info-level
  log calls in the v0.3.4 code path were gated on a successful sync,
  which requires pairing — so a fresh-install unpaired user saw 0 KB
  in `cli-pulse.log`. Now writes a guaranteed startup banner from
  `.setup()` after all plugins install (so the logger is live):
  `CLI Pulse Desktop vX.Y.Z starting on <os> (<arch>)`,
  `Log directory: <path>`,
  `Paired (device 12345678…)` or `Not paired — sign in via Settings`,
  `Background sync loop started — first tick in 20s, then every 120s`.
  Users now have evidence-of-life in the log file regardless of
  paired state.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Server-side dashboard parity** — when signed in, the Providers
  and Overview tabs now display the same plan/quota/tier/cross-device
  metrics that iOS / Android show for the account.
  - **Providers tab** picks up plan badge, quota bar, and tier bars
    (e.g. Claude Max's "5h Window 80/100", "Weekly 66/100", "Sonnet
    only 98/100", "Designs", "Daily Routines"). When a provider has
    no server-side quota data, an honest "Quota data unavailable"
    line appears instead of a fake bar.
  - **Overview tab** gains a 6-tile "All devices — today" grid above
    the existing local-scan section: today_cost, today_usage,
    today_sessions, active_sessions, online_devices,
    unresolved_alerts. The local-scan tiles are now labeled "This
    device" so users can tell server-aggregated from local.
  - All read paths use the existing v0.3.0 OTP infrastructure:
    refresh_token from the OS keychain, lazy/on-demand refresh, 30s
    in-memory cache scoped by user_id and explicitly cleared at
    every auth transition.
- **Single-instance enforcement** (user-flagged 2026-05-02). Launching
  CLI Pulse twice now focuses the existing window instead of spawning
  a duplicate. Uses `tauri-plugin-single-instance` (named-mutex on
  Windows, Unix domain socket on macOS/Linux).
- **File logging** (audit-flagged "no on-disk logs" gap). All app logs
  now write to:
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dev.clipulse.desktop\logs\cli-pulse.log`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/dev.clipulse.desktop/cli-pulse.log`
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/dev.clipulse.desktop/logs/cli-pulse.log`
  Rotation: 5 MB per file, KeepAll. The path is included in the
  Copy-diagnostics block on the About panel so support tickets can
  point at it directly.
- **Server-side unpair**. `Unpair this device` now actually removes
  the device row from Supabase (via the new strictly-additive
  `unregister_desktop_helper` RPC), instead of leaving an orphan that
  accumulated each re-pair. Best-effort: on transient network errors
  the local clear still proceeds (the next sign-in supersedes the
  orphan via `register_desktop_helper`).

### Server-side
Strictly-additive RPC deployed via
`migrate_v0.38_unregister_desktop_helper.sql` in the main repo:

- `unregister_desktop_helper(p_device_id, p_helper_secret)` — anon-
  callable but secret-gated. Returns `{deleted: true,
  remaining_devices}` on success, `{deleted: false, reason:
  'not_found'}` for both genuinely-missing rows and hash-mismatch
  (privacy invariant — same shape as `device_status`).
- Recomputes `profiles.paired = (count post-DELETE > 0)` in the same
  RPC tx so a multi-device account whose Laptop A unregisters while
  Laptop B is still active does NOT get its paired flag flipped to
  false (Codex review fix).

### Privacy
- Refresh-token rotation is now persisted to the keychain BEFORE the
  dashboard RPC call. A process crash between refresh and RPC no
  longer loses the rotated token (Codex review fix).
- Cache scoping is anchored by user_id with belt-and-suspenders
  mismatch checks on read; all auth transitions (sign-in, sign-out,
  unpair, refresh-failure, helper_sync error classifier) explicitly
  invalidate the cache so a re-sign-in as a different user can never
  see the previous account's tile data.

### Translation review
Gemini 3.1 Pro reviewed the new `auth.signin.*`, `overview.tile_*`,
and `providers.*` keys for zh-CN + ja. Caught:
- "Unresolved alerts" — `通知` (notification) → `告警` (zh-CN, matches
  iOS/Mac convention) and `通知` → `アラート` (ja).
- `剩 X/Y` (zh-CN) → `剩余 X/Y` (more polished UI copy).
- `计划` → `套餐` (zh-CN; "plan" in SaaS context).
- `本日のトークン` (ja) → `本日のトークン使用量` (clarifies that it's a
  metric, not a literal token list).
- `クォータ` retained for ja (matches iOS/Mac existing localization).

### Reviews
- VM Claude broader audit (2026-05-02) surfaced the zero-call-sites
  parity gap, the no-on-disk-logs gap, and the orphan-device-row
  cleanup gap — all addressed.
- Codex GPT-5.4 reviewed this spec and surfaced four FIX-FIRSTs:
  multi-device race on `paired = false`, unpair flow's "call server
  then clear local" being unsafe on transient errors, refresh-token
  rotation not persisted in the wrapper, and 30s cache leaking
  across sign-out boundaries. All resolved before execution.

### Notes
- v0.3.3 desktops on auto-update will land on v0.3.4 within minutes.
  Existing pairing survives the upgrade; the v0.3.4 plugins
  (single-instance, log) initialize on first launch with no
  user-visible migration.
- The new dashboard reads only fire when paired AND the user has
  signed in via OTP. Pure-Win/Linux users without a paired Mac will
  see "Quota data unavailable" — honest empty state, not a fake bar.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **About panel didn't reactively update on sign-in.** The Account
  section flipped to "Paired" with the right device_id immediately,
  but the About panel (and its Copy diagnostics block) kept showing
  "Not paired: -" until the next launch. Found during v0.3.2 Win VM
  E2E. AboutSection now refetches the diagnostic snapshot whenever
  the paired state flips.
- **OTP form vanished after unpair until tab switch.** The OTP-flow
  stage state stayed at `signed-in` after a successful sign-out, so
  neither the email-input nor code-input block rendered — the section
  showed only the heading + hint + legacy disclosure. Now reset to
  the email stage on unpair so re-pairing on the same screen works
  without a tab round-trip.
- **Unpair confirmation dialog claimed "new 6-digit code".** That's
  only accurate for the legacy Mac-pair path; on Windows / Linux the
  re-establish flow is the variable-length email OTP. Updated en /
  zh-CN / ja `unpair_confirm` strings to neutral wording covering
  both paths.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **OTP code field truncated to 6 digits, blocking sign-in (P0,
  found during v0.3.1 Win VM E2E).** The Supabase Auth project this
  desktop talks to is configured for 8-digit OTPs (verified against
  the iOS + Android sign-in views, both of which accept variable
  length). The desktop client hardcoded `maxLength={6}` and a
  `.slice(0, 6)` truncation in the OTP input handler, so the last 2
  digits of every code were silently dropped and verification failed.
  Removed the hardcoded length cap on the OTP path; input now accepts
  any digit-only string with a minimum of 4 to enable Verify. Updated
  `auth.signin.code_label` / `auth.signin.hint` strings (en / zh-CN
  / ja) to drop the "6-digit" wording.
  - The legacy "pair from Mac menu bar" path keeps its 6-digit cap;
    that code is server-minted by `generatePairingCode()` on the Mac
    and is genuinely fixed-length.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Multi-device daily-usage clobbering (P0)**. The previous schema
  keyed `daily_usage_metrics` on `(user_id, metric_date, provider,
  model)` — per-user, no device dimension. With v0.3.0 onboarding new
  pure-Win/Linux users alongside their existing Mac scanner, every
  device's 2-minute sync would race-clobber the same row, so dashboard
  totals reflected whichever device synced last instead of the sum.
  v0.3.1 adds `device_id` to the schema PK and aggregates across devices
  in the dashboard read paths.

### Added
- **Tauri daily-usage upload restored** via a new
  `helper_sync_daily_usage` RPC (sibling to `helper_sync` —
  helper-credential auth, 200-row cap, per-row sub-transactions for
  fault isolation). Reports `metrics_synced` / `metrics_errored`
  counts in the manual-sync confirmation message.
- **`get_daily_usage_by_device`** server-side RPC for a future
  per-device breakdown UI ("Mac $5.20 + Win $1.80 = $7.00"). The
  RPC is in place; the UI surface ships separately when ready.

### Server-side migration
Deployed via `migrate_v0.37_daily_usage_device_id.sql` in the main repo:
- Add `device_id uuid` column with the nil-UUID sentinel
  (`'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'`) as default; existing
  rows backfill to the sentinel without a table rewrite.
- Swap PK to `(user_id, device_id, metric_date, provider, model)`.
- Add `devices_id_not_nil_uuid` check constraint so no real device
  row can ever take the sentinel value (Codex review: explicit
  INSERTs could supply nil despite the `gen_random_uuid()` default).
- Replace `upsert_daily_usage` with a 2-arg version (`metrics`,
  `p_device_id` default null). Validates device ownership against
  `auth.uid()` when an explicit device_id is supplied (closes Codex's
  device-name-leak vector through the new `get_daily_usage_by_device`
  join).
- Update `get_daily_usage` to SUM across `device_id` so the public
  JSON shape stays unchanged for iOS/Android consumers.
- Add `get_daily_usage_by_device(days)` RPC, joined on
  `(id, user_id)` so the JOIN cannot leak foreign device names.
- Old 1-arg `upsert_daily_usage(jsonb)` is explicitly DROPed before
  the new 2-arg version is created (Codex review:
  `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` with extra args creates a new overload
  alongside the old, leaving a broken function callable in production).

### macOS scanner
- `APIClient.syncDailyUsage` now passes `HelperConfig.load()?.deviceId`
  as `p_device_id` so the Mac contributes its own row alongside any
  Tauri devices on the same account. Pre-pair / nil cases fall through
  to the sentinel UUID for backward compatibility.

### Architecture decision (recorded in spec)
- Original spec proposed extending `helper_sync` with `p_daily_usage`.
  When pulling the live `helper_sync` body to write the migration, the
  existing function turned out to be much richer than the spec
  assumed (per-device `pg_advisory_xact_lock`, sophisticated session
  column shapes, future-date clamps, two-loop provider-quota model).
  Replacing that body wholesale to add a parameter would carry
  regression risk for v0.3.1. v0.3.1 uses a **sibling RPC**
  (`helper_sync_daily_usage`) instead — 2 RPCs/cycle for Tauri
  (negligible at 2-min cadence). Future v0.4.0 cleanup may unify
  paths once both are stable.

### Reviews
- Gemini 3.1 Pro (product/UX): caught broken rollback strategy when
  multi-device rows exist; spec now has a SUM-collapse rollback
  script.
- Codex GPT-5.4 (SQL/security): caught three FIX-FIRSTs (overload
  semantics, nil-UUID device insertion, foreign device-name leak via
  JOIN). All resolved before deploy.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Direct email sign-in** — pure Windows / Linux users can now onboard
  without owning a Mac. Enter your email in Settings → Sign in to CLI
  Pulse, receive a 6-digit code, and the desktop mints its own helper
  credentials against your Supabase account. New users get auto-signed
  up; existing Mac/iOS account holders sign in to the same account.
  The legacy "pair from a Mac menu bar" 6-digit-code flow is preserved
  under an "Advanced" disclosure.
- **OS-native refresh-token storage** via the `keyring` crate:
  - macOS → Keychain
  - Windows → Credential Manager
  - Linux → Secret Service / libsecret
  Linux without libsecret fails closed with a clear install-hint error
  rather than falling back to weak machine-id-derived encryption.
- **helper_sync error classifier** — when sync hits an auth-shaped
  error (HTTP 401/403, "Device not found"), the desktop now asks the
  server whether the device or account is still healthy via a new
  `device_status` RPC. If the device or account is gone, the desktop
  clears local credentials and shows a "sign in again" notification
  instead of looping on 401s indefinitely.
- **Localization**: new `auth.signin.*` and `messages.signed_in_as`
  keys for English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese (translation
  reviewed by Gemini 3.1 Pro).

### Server-side
- Two new strictly-additive RPCs deployed via
  `migrate_v0.36_desktop_otp.sql` in the main repo:
  - `register_desktop_helper(p_device_name, ...)` — auth.uid()-based
    mirror of `register_helper`. Mints a `device_id + helper_secret`
    against the user's session JWT. Includes per-user 20-device cap
    enforced via `pg_advisory_xact_lock` (race-safe), and
    `set search_path = pg_catalog, public, extensions` to mirror
    existing `register_helper` hardening.
  - `device_status(p_device_id, p_helper_secret)` — anon-callable but
    secret-gated. Returns `'healthy' | 'device_missing' |
    'account_missing'`. Returns `device_missing` for both genuinely
    missing devices and hash-mismatches so it cannot be used to
    enumerate device UUIDs.

### Privacy
- **Sentry scrubber tightened** — the `before_send` hook now redacts
  JWTs, helper secrets (`helper_<64hex>`), and `refresh_token` /
  `access_token` / `helper_secret` / `pairing_code` / `Authorization`
  query parameters embedded in error messages, breadcrumb URLs, and
  request bodies. Org-level field-name scrubbing still applies; this
  is belt-and-suspenders for content-shaped tokens.

### Notes
- v0.3.0 is the first release where Tauri can sign up new accounts
  directly. Mac users with an existing pairing keep working unchanged.
- Refresh strategy is **lazy / on-demand only**: the desktop never
  background-refreshes user JWTs. helper_sync uses device credentials
  exclusively. Refresh runs only when a user-scoped action needs the
  user JWT (rare today; will see more use as future features land).
- v0.3.1 (next release) restores per-device daily-usage syncing for
  the desktop with a multi-device-aware schema.

## [0.2.14] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Sync no longer reports failure after a successful sessions+alerts
  upload (P0).** A cross-platform audit on 2026-05-02 found that every
  paired Windows/Linux desktop was hitting an auth-shape mismatch on the
  daily-usage upload step (the `upsert_daily_usage` RPC required a user
  JWT but Tauri only has the helper's anon-key credentials). Sessions
  and alerts had been landing in Supabase correctly, but the daily-usage
  step bubbled up as a hard error and the entire sync surfaced as
  failed in the manual-sync UI. We've removed the broken call. Per-device
  daily usage is intentionally absent from the desktop until v0.3.1, which
  introduces a multi-device-aware path so Mac and Windows scanners stop
  race-clobbering the same row.
- **Watch auth tokens no longer linger in unprotected UserDefaults
  (P1).** Pre-v0.2.14 builds wrote the access + refresh tokens to both
  the Keychain (canonical) and watchOS UserDefaults (unencrypted at rest).
  v0.2.14 removes the UserDefaults write sites and adds a one-shot
  launch-time migration: any stranded values are adopted into Keychain
  (only when the Keychain is empty for that key — never overwriting a
  fresh value with a stale one) and the UserDefaults entries are cleared.
  No re-authentication required for the common case.
- **Misleading SQL doc comment on `register_helper` (P3).** The block
  comment claimed authentication required `auth.uid()` to match. The
  function actually validates the supplied pairing code and doesn't
  read `auth.uid` at all. Updated the comment to match the implementation
  and forward-reference the `auth.uid()`-based `register_desktop_helper`
  RPC coming in v0.3.0.

### Coming next
- v0.3.0: direct email sign-in for Tauri desktop (no more "find a Mac
  to pair from"). Spec lives at
  `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN_2026-05-02_v0.3.0_otp_login.md`. Pure Windows / Linux
  users get a single-step OTP onboarding.
- v0.3.1: per-device `daily_usage_metrics` so Mac + Windows + Linux all
  contribute correctly to dashboard cost totals across devices.

## [0.2.13] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Misleading pairing instructions (P2 UX).** The Settings tab told users
  to "open CLI Pulse on iOS → Settings → Add device" and copy the 6-digit
  code from the phone. The iOS app has no such UI — `generatePairingCode()`
  is only ever called from the macOS menu bar app
  (`PairingSection.swift:46`), confirmed by repo-wide grep. The instruction
  was a dead-end for everyone, and especially confusing for Windows / Linux
  users who don't own a Mac (those users currently cannot onboard at all).
  - Fix: rewrite `pair_heading` and `pair_hint` in `src/locales/{en,zh-CN,ja}.json`.
    New text points users to the macOS menu bar app (the actual code source)
    and previews v0.3.0's email-based sign-in for Mac-less users.
  - This is a stop-gap. The architectural fix — direct email sign-in on
    Tauri desktop — is tracked in
    `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN_2026-05-02_v0.3.0_otp_login.md` and slated for
    v0.3.0. After v0.3.0 ships, both the new copy and the pairing-code UI
    will be replaced with email + OTP.

### Notes
- v0.2.13 is purely a string change. No Rust changes; no schema changes;
  no behavior changes. The pairing flow itself works correctly when the
  user has a Mac to source the code from.

## [0.2.12] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Opus 4.7 missing from pricing table (P1).** Real-world test on Windows
  surfaced three symptoms that all traced to the same root cause:
  per-row Cost in the Today's Detail table rendered as `—`, the 7-day
  cost trend chart drew an empty frame with no bars, and the Provider
  quota bar in the Providers tab collapsed to invisible. Each pathway
  reads `cost_usd` (or aggregates of it) from the scan result; for any
  unrecognized model, `pricing::claude_cost_usd` returns `None` →
  frontend gets `null` → Cost cell shows `—`, daily totals are 0,
  `maxCost` is 1, all bar heights are 0%. The `claude-opus-4-7` model
  ID was missing from `CLAUDE_MODELS` (the table only covered Opus
  4.5 / 4.6 / 4 / 4.1).
  - Fix: `src-tauri/src/pricing.rs` — add `claude-opus-4-7` entry
    using the same per-token rates as Opus 4.5 / 4.6 (Anthropic's
    pricing pattern for the 4.5+ generation).
  - Test: `claude_cost_opus_4_7_priced_like_4_5_4_6` regression test
    locks the rate in. 8/8 pricing tests pass; 53/53 total Rust tests.
  - User-visible impact: anyone running Claude Code on Opus 4.7 (the
    current default) saw $0.00 / dash everywhere. After upgrading,
    Cost / chart / quota bar all populate from the same scan data
    that was already being collected — no rescan needed; the cache
    holds raw token counts and cost is recomputed on read.

### Notes
- v0.2.11 was held in `prerelease` and never promoted to `latest` once
  this issue surfaced during VM verification. v0.2.12 is the
  first-promotable build of the Sessions-tab fix line.
- Swift / iOS / macOS apps in the main `cli pulse` repo also lack
  Opus 4.7 in their pricing table — tracked separately for the next
  Mac release. Not a desktop blocker.

## [0.2.11] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Sessions tab white-screen on Windows (P1).** Clicking the Sessions tab
  unmounted the entire React tree, leaving only the Tauri window chrome
  visible. No log trail, no crash dump — initial diagnosis (Rust panic /
  WebView2 renderer crash / OS kill) all came up empty during multi-hour
  forensic on the test VM. Real cause was a frontend `TypeError`:
  `App.tsx` rendered `{s.cpu_usage.toFixed(1)}%`, but the backend marked
  `LiveSession::cpu_usage` and `memory_mb` as `#[serde(skip_serializing)]`
  (intent: strip them from the supabase `helper_sync` payload). That
  attribute also stripped them from the Tauri IPC response, so the
  frontend received `undefined` for these fields. `undefined.toFixed()`
  threw at React render time, and React 18's default behavior with no
  `ErrorBoundary` is to unmount the whole tree.
  - Latent since v0.1.0. Not surfaced because the Windows GUI never
    started in any prior release (v0.2.10 was the first version where
    the bundle actually contained the GUI binary). On Linux the bug
    would also fire if the Sessions tab found a matched process; the
    test VM happened to be running Claude Code which the regex picked up.
  - Backend fix (`src-tauri/src/sessions.rs`): split the data model.
    `LiveSession` is now fully serializable (used for Tauri IPC, frontend
    sees all fields). A new `SyncableSession` view is built only when
    constructing the `helper_sync.p_sessions` payload — same fields
    stripped as before, but via an explicit struct boundary instead of
    a serde attribute that affected both consumers.
  - Defense-in-depth #1: NaN sanitization on `cpu_usage`. `sysinfo` on
    Windows can return NaN for short-lived / protected processes where
    the CPU% delta isn't computable. `serde_json` refuses to serialize
    NaN; downstream arithmetic taints with NaN. Floor non-finite values
    to `0.0`.
  - Defense-in-depth #2: `(s.cpu_usage ?? 0).toFixed(1)` in `App.tsx` so
    a missing field becomes `0.0%` rather than a render-time crash.
  - Defense-in-depth #3: new `src/ErrorBoundary.tsx` wraps the App root
    in `main.tsx`. Future render-time exceptions show a structured
    fallback panel (error message + stack + component stack) instead of
    silently unmounting the tree. Click a button to attempt recovery.
  - Tooling fix: enable the Tauri `devtools` feature in `Cargo.toml` so
    Ctrl+Shift+I / F12 opens DOM/console devtools in release builds.
    The v0.2.10 diagnostic was harder than it needed to be because
    devtools were disabled and we couldn't see the JS exception live.
  - Forensic write-up:
    [`PROJECT_FIX_2026-05-01_v0.2.11_sessions_white_screen.md`](PROJECT_FIX_2026-05-01_v0.2.11_sessions_white_screen.md)

## [0.2.10] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **CATASTROPHIC PACKAGING REGRESSION (P0): all v0.1.0–v0.2.9 NSIS,
  `.deb`, and `.rpm` installers shipped without the GUI binary.**
  They contained only `scan_cli` (a sidecar diagnostic CLI tool)
  instead of the main `cli-pulse-desktop` Tauri app. Sizes were
  ~600 KB instead of the expected ~7 MB. Symptom: installer ran
  successfully, registered Start Menu / `.desktop` entries, but
  launching produced a flash of console and no GUI.
  - Root cause: `src-tauri/src/bin/{scan_cli,sessions_smoke}.rs`
    auto-register as cargo bins. Without `default-run` in
    `[package]`, `cargo tauri build` had no canonical "main"
    binary and silently picked `scan_cli` (alphabetically first
    among the auto-detected bins) for the Linux/Windows
    bundlers. AppImage bundler resolves binaries differently and
    was unaffected — that's why no automated test caught it for
    14 versions and the AppImage's 70+ MB size hid the others'
    breakage.
  - Fix: added `default-run = "cli-pulse-desktop"` to
    `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`. Forces a single canonical default
    binary across `cargo build`, `cargo tauri build`, and the
    bundler.
  - **CI guard added** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):
    post-build verification step now asserts NSIS ≥ 1.5 MB
    (LZMA-compressed; healthy build is ~2.7 MB, broken was
    ~0.6 MB), `.deb`/`.rpm` ≥ 3 MB, AppImage ≥ 30 MB, AND
    inspects each archive for the GUI binary by name (`7z l`
    for NSIS, `dpkg-deb -c` for .deb). Failure makes the matrix
    job red so the human un-draft gate notices.
  - Caught by first real human Windows GUI test on Azure VM —
    13 prior releases passed CI matrix because CI only built,
    never installed-and-launched. Adopting "real-VM smoke gate
    before un-drafting" as part of the release contract.
  - v0.2.9 was yanked to draft; `latest.json` redirects to v0.2.8
    until v0.2.10 is verified.
  - Forensic write-up:

## [0.2.9] — 2026-04-27 (YANKED — broken NSIS/.deb/.rpm, see v0.2.10)

### Fixed
- **CRLF byte-offset drift in incremental scan cache.** On Windows,
  JSONL files written with `\r\n` line terminators caused the
  `parsed_bytes` cache to under-count by 1 byte per line. After N
  scans, the next incremental resumption would seek N bytes too
  early — into the middle of the next line — and silently drop its
  first event. Replaced `BufRead::lines()` (which loses the
  terminator's exact byte count) with `read_until(b'\n', &mut buf)`
  + explicit CR/LF stripping. macOS and Linux LF-only users were
  unaffected.
  - Caught by Codex deep review of v0.2.8: *"Next sprint
    recommendation: fix the incremental scanner offset bookkeeping
    first; it's the highest-value correctness risk in the shipped
    product."*
  - 2 new regression tests in `scanner_integration.rs`
    (`crlf_codex_jsonl_parses_identically_to_lf`,
    `crlf_incremental_resume_does_not_drop_lines`) — both fail
    pre-fix, pass post-fix.
  - Forensic write-up:
    [`PROJECT_FIX_2026-04-27_v0.2.9_crlf_offset.md`](PROJECT_FIX_2026-04-27_v0.2.9_crlf_offset.md)

### Added
- **Sentry crash reporting is now LIVE.** Created `desktop` project
  in the existing `jason-yeyuhe.sentry.io` org (alongside `apple-ios`,
  `apple-macos`, `android`). DSN baked into release builds via
  `CLI_PULSE_SENTRY_DSN` GitHub Actions secret. Privacy stance
  unchanged from v0.2.4: `sendDefaultPii=false`,
  `tracesSampleRate=0`, client-side `$HOME` path scrubbing,
  org-level Data Scrubber + Default Scrubbers active. Dev builds
  with no DSN env var continue to be a clean no-op (verified by
  `install_without_dsn_is_a_noop` test).
- Tagged events: `platform=desktop`, `os={windows|linux|macos}`,
  `arch={x86_64|aarch64}`, `app_version=0.2.9` so the dashboard can
  filter cleanly.

### Numbers
- 90 tests now (53 Rust + 25 frontend + 12 integration, was 78).
- Sentry crate adds ~1 MB to release binary; was already in v0.2.4
  but unused. Now actually emits events for crashes / panics on
  release builds.

## [0.2.8] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- **"Update available" banner in the header.** On every app launch
  the frontend silently calls the updater and, if a newer version
  is published, shows a small green pill in the top-right that
  reads `⬆ v0.2.X is available · Update`. Clicking it switches to
  *Settings → Updates* where the user can confirm + install. The
  download is **never** triggered automatically — same consent
  model as v0.1.0, just made discoverable.
- Failure of the update check is silent (offline, GitHub Releases
  edge cache lag, etc.) — no scary error toasts on startup.
- New `updater.banner_available` / `updater.banner_action` keys in
  en / zh-CN / ja.

### Why
Before: the "auto-update" feature required users to remember to
poke *Settings → Updates → Check for updates*. Many users never
will. Now: the visual nudge surfaces whenever a release is available
without breaking the "no surprise installs" privacy stance.

## [0.2.7] — 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **`setLang` no longer fires-and-forgets the i18next promise.**
  `i18next.changeLanguage()` returns a Promise that we previously
  invoked without awaiting or handling rejection — works in
  practice because all locales are bundled at build time, but a
  rejected promise would surface as an unhandled-rejection warning
  in the console. Now returns a Promise (caller can await if it
  cares about completion) and converts any error into a
  `console.warn` so it never crashes the app. Caught by Codex
  review of v0.2.6: *"src/i18n.ts:52: changeLanguage() is not
  awaited, and the tests assume sync language flips."*
- localStorage persistence now happens **before** `changeLanguage`
  so a thrown error during the language switch still leaves the
  user's choice remembered for the next launch.

### Polished
- Empty-state Overview now reads "Scanning ~/.claude and ~/.codex
  for the past 30 days…" while the first scan is in flight, instead
  of showing four mute pulsing rectangles. New `misc.scanning_hint`
  key added in en / zh-CN / ja.
- `sentry_init.rs` doc comment trimmed: was claiming the
  `before_send` filter scrubs `token / secret / password / api_key
  / supabase / claude_api / anthropic / codex / openai / gemini /
  dsn / keychain / pairing / ...` field names client-side, but the
  actual implementation only scrubs `$HOME` paths. Field-name
  scrubbing is delegated to the Sentry org-level Data Scrubber
  settings (matches Swift / Kotlin arrangement, per
  `reference_sentry.md`). Doc now accurately reflects the
  implementation. No behavior change.

## [0.2.6] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Settings → About** panel. Shows app version, platform family +
  arch, paired status (with truncated device id, no secret leakage),
  and a one-click "Copy diagnostics" button that puts a structured
  text block in your clipboard — paste it into a GitHub issue when
  reporting a bug. Includes a link to the repo.
- New Tauri command `diagnostic_snapshot` returns the structured
  data the About panel renders. Sensitive fields (helper_secret,
  user_id, full device_id) are deliberately not exposed.
- `about_*` translation keys added to en / zh-CN / ja.

### Why
First-line support friction: when a user reports an issue I have no
way to confirm what version they're on, what arch / OS, whether
they're paired, etc. without a back-and-forth. The About panel is
also the natural home for any "what's this app" UX a new user
needs.

## [0.2.5] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Frontend test suite** via Vitest + jsdom + Testing Library. 25
  tests covering pure presentation helpers (USD / int formatters, CSV
  escape, RFC-4180 row rendering) and i18n behaviour (localStorage
  persistence, fallback when stored code is unsupported, every required
  UI key resolves non-empty across en / zh-CN / ja).
- `src/lib/format.ts` extracted from `App.tsx` so the formatters are
  importable and testable. App.tsx behaviour byte-identical.
- `npm test` script wired to the CI `frontend` job + `pre-push` hook.
  Frontend regressions now caught before they hit `main`, matching
  the bar Rust already cleared.

### Internal
- `src/test/setup.ts` ships an in-memory localStorage shim so tests
  don't depend on jsdom version quirks (Vitest 2.x + jsdom 25
  occasionally exposes incomplete Storage).
- 53 Rust tests + 25 frontend tests = **78 total tests** across 5
  CI runners.

## [0.2.4] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Brand icons.** Replaced the Tauri scaffold default icons with the
  proper CLI Pulse 1024×1024 brand mark (sourced from the iOS app's
  `AppIcon.appiconset`). Tauri regenerated the per-platform variants
  (NSIS / .icns / Windows tiles / Android mipmaps).
- **Sentry crash + error reporting** wired (`src-tauri/src/sentry_init.rs`).
  No-op when `CLI_PULSE_SENTRY_DSN` is unset (default), so privacy stance
  is "opt-in only." Privacy filter matches the Swift / Kotlin
  counterparts: `sendDefaultPii = false`, `tracesSampleRate = 0`,
  `before_send` scrubs `$HOME` paths. See README → "Optional: Sentry."
- **Pre-push git hook** (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-push`) that runs the
  same gates as CI (rustfmt + clippy + tests + frontend build) before
  every push. One-time install: `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`. Skip
  with `--no-verify`. Motivation: the v0.2.3 host-TZ-dependent test
  bug should never have hit CI.
- README rewritten — full layout map + sprint history + Sentry setup.

### Fixed
- N/A — no production bugs reported since v0.2.3.

### Internal
- `PROJECT_FIX_2026-04-26_v0.2.3_test_tz_dependency.md` archives the
  v0.2.3 test-harness host-TZ-dependency bug (per the project's
  "every fix gets a write-up" policy).

## [0.2.3] — 2026-04-25

### Build / internals (no user-facing changes)
- **Integration test framework** in `src-tauri/tests/scanner_integration.rs`.
  10 fixture-based end-to-end tests that build synthetic JSONL files in
  a temp dir and assert the scanner emits the expected `DailyEntry`
  shapes. Coverage:
  - Codex cumulative `total_token_usage` delta math (3-turn case)
  - Codex pricing applied at the right granularity
  - **Claude per-message tiered pricing** (the bug we caught back in
    Sprint 0 — two 150K-token Sonnet messages must price as 2× $0.45,
    NOT as 300K aggregate which would cross the 200K tier)
  - Streaming-chunk token dedup via `(message.id, requestId)` while the
    `__claude_msg__` synthetic bucket counts every event
  - **Timezone date-range filter** with explicit `today_override`
    (would have caught the v0.2.2 bug)
  - Out-of-range files excluded from the result
  - Cache makes repeat scans idempotent (cold → warm transition)
  - Multi-day events grouped correctly by local date
- `ScanOptions` gained 3 test-only fields: `codex_roots_override`,
  `claude_roots_override`, `today_override`. Production code passes
  `None` and behavior is unchanged. Frontend types untouched.
- 52 / 52 Rust tests pass on macOS (4 platforms × CI matrix similar).
  Up from 42 in v0.2.2.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Timezone scan-range bug.** Non-UTC users (especially JST and other
  UTC+ timezones) saw today's usage stuck at 0 between local 00:00 and
  ~09:00. Per-event day classification was in local time but the scan
  range was anchored on UTC, so today's events got tagged with a
  later date than the filter allowed and were silently dropped from
  the Overview, chart, daily-budget alerts, and helper_sync upload.
  Fixed by anchoring `today`, `since`, `until_key`, and `today_key`
  all on `chrono::Local::now()`. Caught by Codex independent review.
  See [PROJECT_FIX_2026-04-25_v0.2.2_timezone.md](PROJECT_FIX_2026-04-25_v0.2.2_timezone.md).
- 4 new regression tests in `scanner.rs::tests` cover today_key /
  range consistency and `parse_day_key_local` edge cases. 42/42 Rust
  tests pass (was 38).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Providers tab: expandable per-model breakdown.** Click any provider
  row to see the top 10 models contributing to its spend, with input /
  output tokens and per-model cost. Provider rows also show a small
  progress bar relative to the top spender — quick visual ranking.
- **Export scan data.** *Settings → Export* buttons download the last
  30 days of local scan data as CSV (for Excel / Google Sheets) or JSON
  (full `ScanResult` shape, useful for scripting).
  - CSV columns: `date, provider, model, input_tokens, cached_tokens,
    output_tokens, cost_usd, message_count`.
  - Client-side only — no server round-trip.

### Not in this release
- **Server-side `dashboard_summary` on desktop** was considered but
  skipped: the existing RPC requires a user JWT (iOS / macOS / Android
  get one from OAuth signin), while the desktop app authenticates as a
  paired *device* with `helper_secret`. Surfacing server aggregates
  here would require a new `get_daily_usage_for_device` RPC on the
  shared Supabase backend — a cross-project schema change that
  shouldn't be made without an explicit plan.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- **🌏 Internationalization.** UI now ships in English, **简体中文**, and
  **日本語**. Choice persists in `localStorage` and respects the OS
  language on first launch. Switch any time from *Settings → Language*.
  Infra is `i18next` + `react-i18next` (~62 KB gz added to bundle).
- **🖥️ ARM64 builds.** Release + CI workflows now matrix-build on four
  platforms: Windows x64, **Windows ARM64**, Linux x64, **Linux ARM64**.
  Native builds (no QEMU / cross-compile), so the runtime is as fast as
  x64 on equivalent silicon. Latest.json includes all four signatures.

### Build
- CI matrix additions: `windows-11-arm`, `ubuntu-24.04-arm`. Rust cache
  is partitioned by OS key so parallel matrix jobs don't trample each
  other's target directories.
- Release artifacts grow from 4 to 8 installers + 8 .sig files + 1
  latest.json = 17 assets per release.

### Notes
- **Minor version bump (0.1 → 0.2)** because i18n is a substantive new
  user-facing surface. Auto-update path from any 0.1.x continues to
  work — the signing key is unchanged.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-25

### Performance
- **Incremental scan cache** — per-provider JSON state at
  `~/Library/Caches/dev.clipulse.desktop/cost-usage/{codex,claude}-v1.json`
  (Linux: `~/.cache/...`, Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\...`). Files whose
  (mtime, size) are unchanged since the last scan are skipped entirely;
  files that grew are parsed only from their previous size forward.
- **27× faster warm scan** on a dev machine with 2711 JSONL files:
  cold 36.2 s → warm 1.34 s. The 2-minute background sync tick goes
  from "noticeable CPU blip" to "invisible."
- ScanResult now reports `files_scanned` (actually touched) vs
  `files_cached` (reused from cache).

### Fixed
- Nothing user-visible since 0.1.2. Claude cost parity with the macOS
  Swift scanner is bit-exact on 04-18 through 04-21 (verified against
  the same week of local data).

### Build / internals
- New `cache.rs` module (450 lines) — schema ported from Swift
  `CostUsageCache.swift`, with explicit per-file state tracking
  (`mtime`, `size`, `parsed_bytes`, Codex `last_totals` + `session_id`).
- 11 new unit tests for cache arithmetic + decision logic + IO
  roundtrip. 38/38 Rust tests pass.
- `scanner.rs` refactored: parsers return per-file packed output
  instead of mutating global agg; outer loop handles cache decisions.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **7-day cost trend chart on Overview.** Inline SVG, stacked bars by
  provider (Claude green / Codex cyan / Other purple), hover for exact
  per-day breakdown. No new dependencies — <3 KB added to bundle.

### Fixed
- **Sessions project detection no longer surfaces "Library" or "Cellar".**
  Added an explicit filter for OS / toolchain path components
  (Library / Applications / Cellar / Homebrew / node_modules / Program
  Files / AppData / etc.) when extracting project names from cmdlines.
  Strict improvement over v0.1.1 — 5 new tests cover the filter.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Alerts tab** — live view of client-computed alerts, 30-second auto-refresh.
- **Daily / weekly budget alerts** — configurable USD thresholds. When today's
  scanned spend exceeds the daily limit, or the rolling 7-day spend exceeds
  the weekly limit, an alert is pushed into `helper_sync` and a native
  notification fires (once per day per budget).
- **CPU spike alerts** — per-session CPU ≥ 80% (tunable in Settings) triggers
  a "Usage Spike" alert row, mirroring the iOS/macOS apps.
- **Budget settings UI** — Settings → Budget section with daily / weekly /
  CPU% inputs. Persists to `HelperConfig.thresholds` (server never sees
  the threshold, only the resulting alerts).
- New Tauri commands: `get_thresholds`, `set_thresholds`, `preview_alerts`.

### Changed
- `HelperConfig` gained a `thresholds` field; old v0.1.0 configs auto-migrate
  on load via serde defaults.
- `sync_now` / background tick now include computed alerts in helper_sync's
  `p_alerts` array.

### Fixed
- Nothing since v0.1.0 — no user-visible bugs reported in the 0 days it's
  been out 🙂.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- Sprint 0: Local JSONL scanner (Codex + Claude) with bit-exact Swift parity.
- Sprint 1: Supabase pairing via 6-digit code, background `helper_sync` +
  `upsert_daily_usage` every 2 minutes.
- Sprint 2: Live sessions collector (sysinfo-based, 27 provider patterns,
  parent+child worker dedup). System tray with Windows first-class
  behavior and Linux graceful fallback.
- Sprint 2.5: Native notifications on pair success and sync failure
  streak (≥3 consecutive failures).
- Sprint 3: Auto-update via `tauri-plugin-updater` (signed releases
  from GitHub Releases). Settings → Updates button.

### Build
- Rust 1.90 + Tauri 2.10
- React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4
- GitHub Actions CI: frontend + rustfmt + clippy + tests + tauri build
  on Windows and Linux.
- GitHub Actions Release: tag-triggered build + sign + draft release
  with `.exe` / `.deb` / `.rpm` / `.AppImage` + `latest.json`.
